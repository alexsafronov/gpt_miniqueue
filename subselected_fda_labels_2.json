(2.7 , 2.8 ) Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 0.4 mg (0.01 mL or 10 microliters) administered by intravitreal injection. Treatment may be given bilaterally on the same day. Injections may be repeated in each eye. The treatment interval between doses injected into the same eye should be at least 10 days.( 2.9 ) 2.1 Important Injection Instructions For ophthalmic intravitreal injection. EYLEA must only be administered by a qualified physician. Pre-filled Syringe: A 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch sterile injection needle is needed but not provided. Vial: A 5-micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch), a 1-mL Luer lock syringe and a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch sterile injection needle are needed. EYLEA is available packaged as follows: Pre-filled Syringe Vial Kit with Injection Components (filter needle, syringe, injection needle) [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. 2.2 Preparation for Administration \u2013 Pre-filled Syringe The EYLEA pre-filled glass syringe is sterile and for single use only. Do not use the EYLEA pre-filled syringe for the treatment of ROP. The pre-filled syringe should be inspected visually prior to administration. Do not use if particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, or if the package is open or damaged. The appearance of the syringe cap on the pre-filled syringe may vary (for example, color and design). Do not use if any part of the pre-filled syringe is damaged or if the syringe cap is detached from the Luer lock. The intravitreal injection should be performed with a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle (not provided). The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 50 microliters). The excess volume must be discarded prior to the administration. PRE-FILLED SYRINGE DESCRIPTION \u2013 Figure 1: Use aseptic technique to carry out the following steps: 1. PREPARE When ready to administer EYLEA, open the carton and remove sterilized blister pack. Carefully peel open the sterilized blister pack ensuring the sterility of its contents. Keep the syringe in the sterile tray until you are ready for assembly. 2. REMOVE SYRINGE Using aseptic technique, remove the syringe from the sterilized blister pack. 3. TWIST OFF SYRINGE CAP Twist off (do not snap off) the syringe cap by holding the syringe in one hand and the syringe cap with the thumb and forefinger of the other hand (see Figure 2 ). Note: To avoid compromising the sterility of the product, do not pull back on the plunger. Figure 2: 4. ATTACH NEEDLE Using aseptic technique, firmly twist a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 3 ). Figure 3: Note: When ready to administer EYLEA, remove the plastic needle shield from the needle. 5. DISLODGE AIR BUBBLES Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 4 ). Figure 4: 6. EXPEL AIR AND SET THE DOSE To eliminate all bubbles and to expel excess drug, slowly depress the plunger rod to align the plunger dome edge (see Figure 5a ) with the black dosing line on the syringe (equivalent to 50 microliters) (see Figure 5b ). Figure 5a: Figure 5b: 7. The pre-filled syringe is for single use only. After injection any unused product must be discarded. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5a Figure 5b 2.3 Preparation for Administration - Vial EYLEA should be inspected visually prior to administration. If particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, the vial must not be used. The glass vial is for single use only. Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps: Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for single use: a 5-micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch) a 1-mL sterile Luer lock syringe with marking to measure 0.05 mL for adults or 0.01 mL for pre-term infants with ROP a sterile injection needle (30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch) Remove the protective plastic cap from the vial (see Figure 6 ). Figure 6: Clean the top of the vial with an alcohol wipe (see Figure 7 ). Figure 7: Remove the 18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch, 5-micron, filter needle and the 1-mL syringe from their packaging. Attach the filter needle to the syringe by twisting it onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 8 ). Figure 8: Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted into the vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial. Using aseptic technique withdraw all of the EYLEA vial contents into the syringe, keeping the vial in an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. To deter the introduction of air, ensure the bevel of the filter needle is submerged into the liquid. Continue to tilt the vial during withdrawal keeping the bevel of the filter needle submerged in the liquid (see Figure 9a and Figure 9b ). Figure 9a: Figure 9b: Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle. Remove the filter needle from the syringe and properly dispose of the filter needle. Note : Filter needle is not to be used for intravitreal injection. Remove the 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle from its packaging and attach the injection needle to the syringe by firmly twisting the injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 10 ). Figure 10: When ready to administer EYLEA, remove the plastic needle shield from the needle. Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 11 ). Figure 11: Administration in Adults: To eliminate all of the bubbles and to expel excess drug, SLOWLY depress the plunger rod so that the plunger edge aligns with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe (see Figure 12a and Figure 12b ). Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9a Figure 9b Figure 10 Figure 11 Figure 12a and b 2.4 Injection Procedure for Adults The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a topical broad\u2013spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Pre-filled syringe : Inject by pressing the plunger carefully and with constant pressure. Do not apply additional pressure once the plunger has reached the bottom of the syringe. A small residual volume may remain in the syringe after a full dose has been injected. This is normal. Do not administer any residual solution observed in the syringe. Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry. If required, a sterile paracentesis needle should be available. Following intravitreal injection, patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (e.g., eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Each sterile, pre-filled syringe or vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new sterile, pre-filled syringe or vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter, and injection needles should be changed before EYLEA is administered to the other eye. After injection, any unused product must be discarded. 2.5 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 12 weeks (3 months), followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although EYLEA may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when EYLEA was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 12 weeks (3 months). Although not as effective as the recommended every 8 week dosing regimen, patients may also be treated with one dose every 12 weeks after one year of effective therapy. Patients should be assessed regularly. 2.6 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) administered by intravitreal injection once every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) , (14.3) ]. 2.7 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although EYLEA may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when EYLEA was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months). 2.8 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although EYLEA may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when EYLEA was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months). 2.9 Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) Recommended Dosage The recommended dose for EYLEA is 0.4 mg (0.01 mL or 10 microliters) administered by intravitreal injection. Treatment is initiated with a single injection per eligible eye and may be given bilaterally on the same day. Injections may be repeated in each eye. The treatment interval between doses injected into the same eye should be at least 10 days [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. Administration Instructions in Pre-Term Infants with ROP The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a topical broad\u2013spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry. If required, a sterile paracentesis needle should be available. Following intravitreal injection, patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (e.g., eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Each sterile vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. Do not use the EYLEA pre-filled syringe for the treatment of ROP. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new sterile vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter, and injection needles should be changed before EYLEA is administered to the other eye. Follow steps 1-10 listed in 2.3 Preparation for Administration \u2013 Vial. 11 . To eliminate all of the bubbles and to expel excess drug, SLOWLY depress the plunger rod so that the plunger edge aligns with the line that marks 0.01 mL on the syringe (see Figure 13a and Figure 13b ). For the treatment of ROP, the injection needle should be inserted into the eye 1 mm from the limbus with the needle angled to avoid the lens and to avoid the retina. After injection, any unused product must be discarded.

Hypersensitivity reactions may manifest as rash, pruritus, urticaria, severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, or severe intraocular inflammation."], "warnings_and_cautions": ["5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. ( 5.1 ) Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal injection. ( 5.2 ) In infants with ROP, treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring ( 5.3 ) There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments Intravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.2 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.3 Extended Monitoring and Additional Treatment in ROP Reactivation of abnormal angiogenesis and tortuosity may occur following treatment with EYLEA. Infants should be monitored closely after injection with EYLEA until retinal vascularization has completed or until the examiner is assured that reactivation of ROP will not occur. In infants with ROP, treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring and additional EYLEA injections and/or laser treatments may be necessary. 5.4 Thromboembolic Events There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Adequate and well-controlled studies with EYLEA have not been conducted in pregnant women. Aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits, including external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. A fetal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects, systemic exposures (based on AUC for free aflibercept) were approximately 6 times higher than AUC values observed in humans after a single intravitreal treatment at the recommended clinical dose [see Animal Data ]. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether EYLEA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for aflibercept [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ], treatment with EYLEA may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. EYLEA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In two embryofetal development studies, aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects when administered every three days during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses \u22653 mg per kg, or every six days during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses \u22650.1 mg per kg. Adverse embryofetal effects included increased incidences of postimplantation loss and fetal malformations, including anasarca, umbilical hernia, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, cleft palate, ectrodactyly, intestinal atresia, spina bifida, encephalomeningocele, heart and major vessel defects, and skeletal malformations (fused vertebrae, sternebrae, and ribs; supernumerary vertebral arches and ribs; and incomplete ossification). The maternal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) in these studies was 3 mg per kg. Aflibercept produced fetal malformations at all doses assessed in rabbits and the fetal NOAEL was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits (0.1 mg per kg), systemic exposure (AUC) of free aflibercept was approximately 6 times higher than systemic exposure (AUC) observed in adult patients after a single intravitreal dose of 2 mg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of aflibercept in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, EYLEA is not recommended during breastfeeding. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for EYLEA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from EYLEA. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females of reproductive potential are advised to use effective contraception prior to the initial dose, during treatment, and for at least 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of EYLEA. Infertility There are no data regarding the effects of EYLEA on human fertility. Aflibercept adversely affected female and male reproductive systems in cynomolgus monkeys when administered by intravenous injection at a dose approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic level observed in adult patients with an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. These findings were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of EYLEA have been demonstrated in two clinical studies of pre-term infants with ROP. These two studies randomized pre-term infants between initial treatment with EYLEA or laser. Efficacy of each treatment is supported by the demonstration of a clinical course which was better than would have been expected without treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies, approximately 76% (2049/2701) of patients randomized to treatment with EYLEA were \u226565 years of age and approximately 46% (1250/2701) were \u226575 years of age.

Aflibercept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a protein molecular weight of 97 kilodaltons (kDa) and contains glycosylation, constituting an additional 15% of the total molecular mass, resulting in a total molecular weight of 115 kDa. Aflibercept is produced in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. EYLEA (aflibercept) Injection is a sterile, clear, and colorless to pale yellow solution. EYLEA is supplied as a preservative-free, sterile, aqueous solution for intravitreal injection in a single-dose pre-filled glass syringe or a single-dose glass vial designed to deliver 0.05 mL (50 microliters) of solution containing 2 mg of aflibercept in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 40 mM sodium chloride, 0.03% polysorbate 20, and 5% sucrose, with a pH of 6.2."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leucocytes. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability. Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) In the clinical studies anatomic measures of disease activity improved similarly in all treatment groups from baseline to week 52. Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions during the first year. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in COPERNICUS, GALILEO, and VIBRANT at week 24 compared to baseline. Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.2) , (14.3) ]. Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in VIVID and VISTA at weeks 52 and 100 compared to baseline. Anatomic data were not used to influence EYLEA treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics EYLEA is administered intravitreally to exert local effects in the eye. In patients with wet AMD, RVO, or DME, following intravitreal administration of EYLEA, a fraction of the administered dose is expected to bind with endogenous VEGF in the eye to form an inactive aflibercept: VEGF complex. Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, aflibercept presents in the plasma as free aflibercept (unbound to VEGF) and a more predominant stable inactive form with circulating endogenous VEGF (i.e., aflibercept: VEGF complex). Absorption/Distribution Following intravitreal administration of 2 mg per eye of EYLEA to patients with wet AMD, RVO, and DME, the mean C max of free aflibercept in the plasma was 0.02 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.054 mcg/mL), 0.05 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.081 mcg/mL), and 0.03 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.076 mcg/mL), respectively and was attained in 1 to 3 days. The free aflibercept plasma concentrations were undetectable two weeks post-dosing in all patients. Aflibercept did not accumulate in plasma when administered as repeated doses intravitreally every 4 weeks. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to patients, the mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100 fold lower than the concentration of aflibercept required to half-maximally bind systemic VEGF. The volume of distribution of free aflibercept following intravenous (I.V.) administration of aflibercept has been determined to be approximately 6L. Metabolism/Elimination Aflibercept is a therapeutic protein and no drug metabolism studies have been conducted. Aflibercept is expected to undergo elimination through both target-mediated disposition via binding to free endogenous VEGF and metabolism via proteolysis. The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 5 to 6 days after I.V. administration of doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg aflibercept. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetics of aflibercept were evaluated in pre-term infants with ROP at a dose of 0.4 mg aflibercept (per eye) administered unilaterally or bilaterally. In the BUTTERFLEYE study, mean concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma declined from a maximum of 0.583 mcg/mL at Day 1 to 0.0406 mcg/mL at Day 28 in bilaterally treated patients. In the FIREFLEYE study, mean concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma for all patients (bilateral and unilateral administration combined) declined from a maximum of 0.481 mcg/mL at Day 1 to 0.13 mcg/mL at Day 28. Concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma subsequently declined to values below or close to the lower limit of quantitation within approximately 8 weeks. Following an IVT dose of aflibercept 0.4 mg per eye given bilaterally at 10 or 14 day intervals, the population pharmacokinetic estimated mean maximal accumulation ratio of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 2.0 and 1.4. No accumulation of free aflibercept in plasma is expected for IVT doses of 0.4 mg per eye given bilaterally at dosing intervals of 21 days or longer. Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analysis of a subgroup of patients (n=492) in one wet AMD study, of which 43% had renal impairment (mild n=120, moderate n=74, and severe n=16), revealed no differences with respect to plasma concentrations of free aflibercept after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks. Similar results were seen in patients in a RVO study and in patients in a DME study. No dose adjustment based on renal impairment status is needed for either wet AMD, RVO, or DME patients . Other No dosage modification is required based on gender or in the elderly. 12.6 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for an immune response in patients treated with EYLEA. The immunogenicity of EYLEA was evaluated in serum samples. The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to EYLEA in immunoassays. The detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays used, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to EYLEA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In the wet AMD, RVO, and DME studies, the pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to EYLEA was approximately 1% to 3% across treatment groups. After dosing with EYLEA for 24-100 weeks, antibodies to EYLEA were detected in a similar percentage range of patients. Similarly, after unilateral or bilateral dosing in pediatric ROP studies, antibodies to EYLEA were detected in less than 1% of patients. There were no differences in efficacy or safety between patients with or without immunoreactivity."], "mechanism_of_action": ["12.1 Mechanism of Action Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leucocytes. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability. Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors."], "pharmacodynamics": ["12.2 Pharmacodynamics Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) In the clinical studies anatomic measures of disease activity improved similarly in all treatment groups from baseline to week 52. Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions during the first year.

Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.2) , (14.3) ]. Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in VIVID and VISTA at weeks 52 and 100 compared to baseline. Anatomic data were not used to influence EYLEA treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]."], "pharmacokinetics": ["12.3 Pharmacokinetics EYLEA is administered intravitreally to exert local effects in the eye. In patients with wet AMD, RVO, or DME, following intravitreal administration of EYLEA, a fraction of the administered dose is expected to bind with endogenous VEGF in the eye to form an inactive aflibercept: VEGF complex. Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, aflibercept presents in the plasma as free aflibercept (unbound to VEGF) and a more predominant stable inactive form with circulating endogenous VEGF (i.e., aflibercept: VEGF complex). Absorption/Distribution Following intravitreal administration of 2 mg per eye of EYLEA to patients with wet AMD, RVO, and DME, the mean C max of free aflibercept in the plasma was 0.02 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.054 mcg/mL), 0.05 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.081 mcg/mL), and 0.03 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.076 mcg/mL), respectively and was attained in 1 to 3 days. The free aflibercept plasma concentrations were undetectable two weeks post-dosing in all patients. Aflibercept did not accumulate in plasma when administered as repeated doses intravitreally every 4 weeks. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to patients, the mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100 fold lower than the concentration of aflibercept required to half-maximally bind systemic VEGF. The volume of distribution of free aflibercept following intravenous (I.V.) administration of aflibercept has been determined to be approximately 6L. Metabolism/Elimination Aflibercept is a therapeutic protein and no drug metabolism studies have been conducted. Aflibercept is expected to undergo elimination through both target-mediated disposition via binding to free endogenous VEGF and metabolism via proteolysis. The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 5 to 6 days after I.V. administration of doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg aflibercept. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetics of aflibercept were evaluated in pre-term infants with ROP at a dose of 0.4 mg aflibercept (per eye) administered unilaterally or bilaterally. In the BUTTERFLEYE study, mean concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma declined from a maximum of 0.583 mcg/mL at Day 1 to 0.0406 mcg/mL at Day 28 in bilaterally treated patients. In the FIREFLEYE study, mean concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma for all patients (bilateral and unilateral administration combined) declined from a maximum of 0.481 mcg/mL at Day 1 to 0.13 mcg/mL at Day 28. Concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma subsequently declined to values below or close to the lower limit of quantitation within approximately 8 weeks. Following an IVT dose of aflibercept 0.4 mg per eye given bilaterally at 10 or 14 day intervals, the population pharmacokinetic estimated mean maximal accumulation ratio of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 2.0 and 1.4. No accumulation of free aflibercept in plasma is expected for IVT doses of 0.4 mg per eye given bilaterally at dosing intervals of 21 days or longer. Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analysis of a subgroup of patients (n=492) in one wet AMD study, of which 43% had renal impairment (mild n=120, moderate n=74, and severe n=16), revealed no differences with respect to plasma concentrations of free aflibercept after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks.

Figure 17 14.5 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Efficacy and safety data of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy (DR) are derived from the VIVID, VISTA, and PANORAMA studies. VIVID AND VISTA In the VIVID and VISTA studies, an efficacy outcome was the change in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (ETDRS-DRSS). The ETDRS-DRSS score was assessed at baseline and approximately every 6 months thereafter for the duration of the studies [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. All enrolled patients had DR and DME at baseline. The majority of patients enrolled in these studies (77%) had moderate-to-severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) based on the ETDRS-DRSS. At week 100, the proportion of patients improving by at least 2 steps on the ETDRS-DRSS was significantly greater in both EYLEA treatment groups (2Q4 and 2Q8) when compared to the control group. Results from the analysis of ETDRS-DRSS at week 100 in the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 9 below.

PANORAMA The PANORAMA study assessed the safety and efficacy of EYLEA in a randomized, multi-center, double-masked, controlled study in patients with moderately severe to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (ETDRS-DRSS of 47 or 53), without central-involved DME (CI-DME). A total of 402 randomized patients were evaluable for efficacy. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days for the first 5 visits, then every 8 weeks (56\u00b17 days). Patient ages ranged from 25 to 85 years with a mean of 55.7 years. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 1) 3 initial monthly EYLEA 2 mg injections followed by one injection after 8 weeks and then one injection every 16 weeks (EYLEA 2Q16); 2) 5 monthly EYLEA 2 mg injections followed by one injection every 8 weeks (EYLEA 2Q8); and 3) sham treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who improved by \u22652 steps on the DRSS from baseline to week 24 in the combined EYLEA groups and at week 52 in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups individually versus sham. A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients developing the composite endpoint of proliferative diabetic retinopathy or anterior segment neovascularization through week 52. At week 52, efficacy in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups was superior to the sham group (see Table 10 and Table 11 ). The proportion of patients with a \u22652-step improvement over time is shown in Figure 18.

Both BUTTERFLEYE and FIREFLEYE studies assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of EYLEA in randomized, 2-arm, open-label, parallel-group studies. The studies were conducted in pre-term infants with ROP providing a comparison between EYLEA treatment and laser photocoagulation therapy (laser). Each eligible eye received the assigned study treatment at baseline. Re-treatment and/or rescue treatment was administered if needed based on pre-specified criteria. Rescue treatment could potentially include the alternative treatment (EYLEA or laser). Re-treatment with aflibercept, if required, was administered up to 2 times in a particular eye, with at least 28 days between consecutive injections. Eligible patients had a maximum gestational age at birth of 32 weeks or a maximum birth weight of 1500 g, had to weigh > 800 g on the day of treatment and had treatment-na\u00efve ROP classified according to the International Classification for Retinopathy of Prematurity (IC-ROP 2005) in at least one eye with one of the following retinal findings: ROP Zone 1 Stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+, or ROP Zone II Stage 2+ or 3+, or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior ROP) The primary efficacy endpoint of each study was the proportion of patients with absence of active ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes (retinal detachment, macular dragging, macular fold, retrolental opacity) at week 52 of chronological age. In BUTTERFLEYE, patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens: 1) EYLEA 0.4 mg at baseline and if required, up to 2 additional injections and 2) laser photocoagulation in each eye at baseline and if required, retreatment. In FIREFLEYE, patients were randomized to the same two treatments, but in a 2:1 ratio. Rescue treatment was administered if required, per pre-specified criteria. In both studies, greater than 92% of all treated patients in the aflibercept group received bilateral injections during the study. Results from week 52 of chronological age in the BUTTERFLEYE and FIREFLEYE/FIREFLEYE NEXT studies are shown in Table 12 below. The proportion of patients without clinically significant reactivations of ROP who also did not develop unfavorable structural outcomes was higher in each arm of each study than would have been expected in infants who had not received treatment. Neither trial demonstrated superiority of one arm compared to the other arm. Neither trial demonstrated inferiority of one arm compared to the other arm. Table 12: Efficacy Outcomes at Week 52 Chronological Age in BUTTERFLEYE and FIREFLEYE/FIREFLEYE NEXT Studies BUTTERFLEYE In case of bilateral treatment, success was achieved only if both eyes met the primary endpoint. Treatment interval between 2 doses injected into the same eye had to be at least 28 days.

Concomitant use of GLIPIZIDE XL with other anti-diabetic medication can increase the risk of hypoglycemia. A lower dose of GLIPIZIDE XL may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when combining it with other anti-diabetic medications. Educate patients to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. When initiating and increasing GLIPIZIDE XL in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients on other anti-diabetic medications) start at 2.5 mg. Debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal, pituitary, or hepatic impairment are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of anti-diabetic medications. Hypoglycemia is also more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, or when alcohol is ingested. The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced in patients with autonomic neuropathy, the elderly, and in patients who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking medications or other sympatholytic agents. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia before the patient is aware of the hypoglycemia . These impairments may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. 5.2 Hemolytic Anemia Treatment of patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents, including GLIPIZIDE XL, can lead to hemolytic anemia. Avoid use of GLIPIZIDE XL in patients with G6PD deficiency. In post marketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency. 5.3 Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality with Sulfonylureas The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2\u00bd times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glipizide and of alternative modes of therapy. Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure. 5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with GLIPIZIDE XL or any other anti-diabetic drug. 5.5 Gastrointestinal Obstruction There have been reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of another drug with this non-dissolvable extended release formulation. Avoid use of GLIPIZIDE XL in patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic)."], "adverse_reactions": ["6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail below and elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Hemolytic anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 3%) are dizziness, diarrhea, nervousness, tremor, hypoglycemia and flatulence ( 6.1 ).

In clinical trials, 580 patients from 31 to 87 years of age received GLIPIZIDE XL in doses from 5 mg to 60 mg in both controlled and open trials. The dosages above 20 mg are not recommended dosages. In these trials, approximately 180 patients were treated with GLIPIZIDE XL for at least 6 months. Table 1 summarizes the incidence of adverse reactions, other than hypoglycemia, that were reported in pooled double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in \u22653% of GLIPIZIDE XL-treated patients and more commonly than in patients who received placebo.

Hypoglycemia was not reported for any placebo patients. Gastrointestinal Reactions In clinical trials, the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia), occurred in less than 3% of GLIPIZIDE XL-treated patients and were more common in GLIPIZIDE XL-treated patients than those receiving placebo. Dermatologic Reactions In clinical trials, allergic skin reactions, i.e., urticaria occurred in less than 1.5% of treated patients and were more common in GLIPIZIDE XL treated patients than those receiving placebo. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of glipizide XL; if skin reactions persist, the drug should be discontinued. Laboratory Tests Mild to moderate elevations of ALT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, BUN and creatinine have been noted. The relationship of these abnormalities to glipizide is uncertain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of GLIPIZIDE XL.

Severe hypoglycemia can occur when GLIPIZIDE and oral miconazole are used concomitantly ( 7.2 , 12.3 ). \u25aa Fluconazole: Monitor patients closely. An increase in GLIPIZIDE AUC was seen after fluconazole administration ( 7.3 , 12.3 ). \u25aa Colesevelam: GLIPIZIDE XL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam ( 7.4 , 12.3 ). 7.1 Drugs Affecting Glucose Metabolism A number of medications affect glucose metabolism and may require GLIPIZIDE XL dose adjustment and close monitoring for hypoglycemia or worsening glycemic control. The following are examples of medication that may increase the glucose lowering effect of GLIPIZIDE XL, increase the susceptibility to and/or intensity of hypoglycemia: antidiabetic agents, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, pentoxifylline, pramlintide, propoxyphene, salicylates, somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide), sulfonamide antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, voriconazole, H2 receptor antagonists, and quinolones. When these medications are administered to a patient receiving GLIPIZIDE XL, monitor the patient closely for hypoglycemia. When these medications are discontinued from a patient receiving GLIPIZIDE XL, monitor the patient closely for worsening glycemic control. The following are examples of medication that may reduce the glucose-lowering effect of GLIPIZIDE XL, leading to worsening glycemic control: atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine), corticosteroids, danazol, diuretics, estrogens, glucagon, isoniazid, niacin, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., albuterol, epinephrine, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, and calcium channel blocking drugs. When such drugs are administered to patients receiving GLIPIZIDE XL, monitor the patients closely for worsening glycemic control. When these medications are discontinued from patients receiving GLIPIZIDE XL, monitor the patient closely for hypoglycemia. Alcohol, beta-blockers, clonidine, and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of the glucose-lowering effect. Increased frequency of monitoring may be required when GLIPIZIDE XL is co-administered with these drugs. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. Increased frequency of monitoring may be required when GLIPIZIDE XL is co-administered with these drugs. 7.2 Miconazole Monitor patients closely for hypoglycemia when Glipizide XL is co-administered with miconazole. A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported [see Clinical Phamacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Fluconazole Monitor patients closely for hypoglycemia when Glipizide XL is co-administered with fluconazole. Concomitant treatment with fluconazole increases plasma concentrations of glipizide, which may lead to hypoglycemia [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.4 Colesevelam GLIPIZIDE XL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to the administration of colesevelam. Colesevelam can reduce the maximum plasma concentration and total exposure of glipizide when the two are coadministered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."], "use_in_specific_populations": ["8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u25aa Geriatric, Hepatically Impaired Patients: At risk for hypoglycemia with GLIPIZIDE XL. Use caution in dose selection and titration, and monitor closely ( 8.5 , 8.6 ). 8.1. Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from a small number of published studies and postmarketing experience with GLIPIZIDE XL use in pregnancy over decades have not identified any drug associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal outcomes. However, sulfonylureas (including glipizide) cross the placenta and have been associated with neonatal adverse reactions such as hypoglycemia. Therefore, GLIPIZIDE XL should be discontinued at least two weeks before expected delivery (see Clinical Considerations ). Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy is also associated with risks to the mother and fetus (see Clinical Considerations ). In animal studies, there were no effects on embryofetal development following administration of glipizide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 833 times and 8 times the human dose based on body surface area, respectively. However, increased pup mortality was observed in rats administered glipizide from gestation day 15 throughout lactation at doses 2 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6\u201310% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20\u201325% in women with HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly-controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, preterm delivery, stillbirth, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Neonates of women with gestational diabetes who are treated with sulfonylureas during pregnancy may be at increased risk for neonatal intensive care admission and may develop respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, birth injury, and be large for gestational age. Prolonged severe hypoglycemia, lasting 4\u201310 days, has been reported in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery and has been reported with the use of agents with a prolonged half-life. Observe newborns for symptoms of hypoglycemia and respiratory distress and manage accordingly. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Due to reports of prolonged severe hypoglycemia in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery, Glipizide XL should be discontinued at least two weeks before expected delivery (see Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions ) . Data Animal Data In teratology studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received daily oral doses of glipizide during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 833 and 8 times the human dose based on body surface area), respectively. There were no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development at any of the doses tested. In a peri- and postnatal study in pregnant rats, there was a reduced number of pups born alive following administration of glipizide from gestation day 15 throughout lactation through weaning at doses \u22655 mg/kg/day (about 2 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area). 8.2. Lactation Risk Summary Breastfed infants of lactating women using GLIPIZIDE XL should be monitored for symptoms of hypoglycemia (see Clinical Considerations ) . Although glipizide was undetectable in human milk in one small clinical lactation study; this result is not conclusive because of the limitations of the assay used in the study. There are no data on the effects of glipizide on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for GLIPIZIDE XL and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from GLIPIZIDE XL or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for adverse reactions Monitor breastfed infants for signs of hypoglycemia (e.g., jitters, cyanosis, apnea, hypothermia, excessive sleepiness, poor feeding, seizures). 8.4. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There were no overall differences in effectiveness or safety between younger and older patients, but greater sensitivity of some individuals cannot be ruled out. Elderly patients are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in these patients. Therefore, dosing should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment There is no information regarding the effects of hepatic impairment on the disposition of glipizide. However, since glipizide is highly protein bound and hepatic biotransformation is the predominant route of elimination, the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of glipizide may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment. If hypoglycemia occurs in such patients, it may be prolonged and appropriate management should be instituted [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."], "pregnancy": ["8.1.

The Chemical Abstracts name of glipizide is 1-cyclohexyl-3-[[p-[2-(5-methylpyrazinecarboxamido)ethyl] phenyl]sulfonyl]urea. The molecular formula is C 21 H 27 N 5 O 4 S; the molecular weight is 445.55; the structural formula is shown below: Glipizide is a whitish, odorless powder with a pKa of 5.9. It is insoluble in water and alcohols, but soluble in 0.1 N NaOH; it is freely soluble in dimethylformamide. Each tablet contains 2.75 mg glipizide to provide a 2.5 mg dose. Each tablet contains 5.49 mg glipizide to provide a 5 mg dose. Each tablet contains 10.98 mg glipizide to provide a 10 mg dose. Inert ingredients in the 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg formulations are: polyethylene oxide, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, sodium chloride, red ferric oxide, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, Opadry \u00ae blue (OY-LS-20921)(2.5 mg tablets), Opadry \u00ae white (YS-2-7063)(5 mg and 10 mg tablet) and Opacode \u00ae Black Ink (S-1-17823). System Components and Performance GLIPIZIDE XL Extended Release Tablet is similar in appearance to a conventional tablet. It consists, however, of an osmotically active drug core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The core itself is divided into two layers: an \"active\" layer containing the drug, and a \"push\" layer containing pharmacologically inert (but osmotically active) components. The membrane surrounding the tablet is permeable to water but not to drug or osmotic excipients. As water from the gastrointestinal tract enters the tablet, pressure increases in the osmotic layer and \"pushes\" against the drug layer, resulting in the release of drug through a small, laser-drilled orifice in the membrane on the drug side of the tablet. The function of the GLIPIZIDE XL Extended Release Tablet depends upon the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the bi-layer core and fluid in the GI tract. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during GI transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Glipizide primarily lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor in the pancreatic beta-cell plasma membrane, leading to closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, thereby stimulating the release of insulin. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The insulinotropic response to a meal is enhanced with GLIPIZIDE XL administration in diabetic patients. The postprandial insulin and C-peptide responses continue to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment. In two randomized, double-blind, dose-response studies comprising a total of 347 patients, there was no significant increase in fasting insulin in all GLIPIZIDE XL-treated patients combined compared to placebo, although minor elevations were observed at some doses. In studies of GLIPIZIDE XL in subjects with type 2 diabete mellitus, once daily administration produced reductions in hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose. The relationship between dose and reduction in hemoglobin A1c was not established, however subjects treated with 20 mg had a greater reduction in fasting plasma glucose compared to subjects treated with 5 mg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of glipizide was 100% after single oral doses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Beginning 2 to 3 hours after administration of GLIPIZIDE XL, plasma drug concentrations gradually rise reaching maximum concentrations within 6 to 12 hours after dosing. With subsequent once daily dosing of GLIPIZIDE XL, plasma glipizide concentrations are maintained throughout the 24 hour dosing interval with less peak to trough fluctuation than that observed with twice daily dosing of immediate release glipizide. The mean relative bioavailability of glipizide in 21 males with type 2 diabetes mellitus after administration of 20 mg GLIPIZIDE XL, compared to immediate release Glipizide (10 mg given twice daily), was 90% at steady-state. Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved by at least the fifth day of dosing with GLIPIZIDE XL in 21 males with type 2 diabetes mellitus and patients younger than 65 years. No accumulation of drug was observed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during chronic dosing with GLIPIZIDE XL. Administration of GLIPIZIDE XL with food has no effect on the 2 to 3 hour lag time in drug absorption. In a single dose, food effect study in 21 healthy male subjects, the administration of GLIPIZIDE XL immediately before a high fat breakfast resulted in a 40% increase in the glipizide mean C max value, which was significant, but the effect on the AUC was not significant. There was no change in glucose response between the fed and fasting state. Markedly reduced GI retention times of the GLIPIZIDE XL tablets over prolonged periods (e.g., short bowel syndrome) may influence the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug and potentially result in lower plasma concentrations. In a multiple dose study in 26 males with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the pharmacokinetics of glipizide were linear with GLIPIZIDE XL in that the plasma drug concentrations increased proportionately with dose. In a single dose study in 24 healthy subjects, four 5-mg, two 10-mg, and one 20-mg GLIPIZIDE XL tablets were bioequivalent. In a separate single dose study in 36 healthy subjects, four 2.5-mg GLIPIZIDE XL tablets were bioequivalent to one 10-mg GLIPIZIDE XL tablet. Distribution The mean volume of distribution was approximately 10 liters after single intravenous doses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Glipizide is 98\u201399% bound to serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Metabolism The major metabolites of glipizide are products of aromatic hydroxylation and have no hypoglycemic activity. A minor metabolite, an acetylamino-ethyl benzene derivative, which accounts for less than 2% of a dose, is reported to have 1/10 to 1/3 as much hypoglycemic activity as the parent compound. Elimination Glipizide is eliminated primarily by hepatic biotransformation: less than 10% of a dose is excreted as unchanged drug in urine and feces; approximately 90% of a dose is excreted as biotransformation products in urine (80%) and feces (10%). The mean total body clearance of glipizide was approximately 3 liters per hour after single intravenous doses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mean terminal elimination half-life of glipizide ranged from 2 to 5 hours after single or multiple doses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Specific Populations Pediatric: Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of glipizide in pediatric patients have not been performed. Geriatric: There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of glipizide after single dose administration to older diabetic subjects compared to younger healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of glipizide has not been evaluated in patients with varying degree of renal impairment. Limited data indicates that glipizide biotransformation products may remain in circulation for a longer time in subjects with renal impairment than that seen in subjects with normal renal function. Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of glipizide has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. Drug-drug Interactions Miconazole A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral glipizide leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole is not known [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Fluconazole Concomitant treatment with fluconazole increases plasma concentrations of glipizide. The effect of concomitant administration of Diflucan \u00ae (fluconazole) and Glipizide has been demonstrated in a placebo controlled crossover study in healthy volunteers. All subjects received Glipizide alone and following treatment with 100 mg of Diflucan \u00ae as a single daily oral dose for 7 days. The mean percentage increase in the glipizide AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81%) [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Colesevelam Colesevelam can reduce the maximum plasma concentration and total exposure of glipizide when the two are coadministered. In studies assessing the effect of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide ER in healthy volunteers, reductions in glipizide AUC 0\u2013\u221e and C max of 12% and 13%, respectively were observed when colesevelam was coadministered with glipizide ER. When glipizide ER was administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam, there was no significant change in glipizide AUC 0\u2013\u221e or C max , -4% and 0%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] ."], "mechanism_of_action": ["12.1 Mechanism of Action Glipizide primarily lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets.

Revised 10/2018 PATIENT INFORMATION GLIPIZIDE XL (glipizide) extended release tablets What is GLIPIZIDE XL? \u2022 GLIPIZIDE XL is a prescription medicine you take by mouth used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. \u2022 GLIPIZIDE XL is not for people with type 1 diabetes or people with diabetic ketoacidosis. It is not known if GLIPIZIDE XL is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age. Who Should Not Take GLIPIZIDE XL? Do not use GLIPIZIDE XL if you: \u2022 have a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis \u2022 have ever had an allergic reaction to glipizide or any of the other ingredients in GLIPIZIDE XL. See the end of this Patient Information for a complete list of ingredients in GLIPIZIDE XL. What should I tell my doctor before taking GLIPIZIDE XL? Before you take GLIPIZIDE XL, tell your healthcare provider if you: \u2022 Have ever had a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis \u2022 Have kidney or liver problems \u2022 Have had a blockage or narrowing of your intestines due to illness or past surgery \u2022 Have chronic (continuing) diarrhea \u2022 Have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. This condition usually runs in families. People with G6PD deficiency who take GLIPIZIDE XL may develop hemolytic anemia (fast breakdown of red blood cells). \u2022 Are pregnant or might be pregnant. It is not known if GLIPIZIDE XL will harm your unborn baby. If you are pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. You should not take GLIPIZIDE XL during the last two weeks of pregnancy. \u2022 Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if GLIPIZIDE XL passes into your breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide the best way to feed your baby during treatment with GLIPIZIDE XL. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take , including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. GLIPIZIDE XL may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how GLIPIZIDE XL works. Some medicines can affect how well GLIPIZIDE XL works or may affect you blood sugar level. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take GLIPIZIDE XL? \u2022 Take GLIPIZIDE XL exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it. \u2022 Your healthcare provider will tell you how much GLIPIZIDE XL to take and when to take it. \u2022 Take GLIPIZIDE XL by mouth, 1 time each day with breakfast or your first meal of the day. \u2022 Each GLIPIZIDE XL tablet will release the medicine slowly over 24 hours. This is why you take it only 1 time each day. \u2022 Swallow the GLIPIZIDE XL whole. Do not break, crush, dissolve, chew, or cut the tablet in half. This will damage the tablet and release too much medicine into your body at one time. \u2022 When you take GLIPIZIDE XL you may see something in your stool that looks like a tablet. This is the empty shell from the tablet. It is normal for the empty shell to pass with your bowel movement after medicine has been absorbed by your body. \u2022 It is important to take GLIPIZIDE XL every day to help keep your blood sugar level under good control. Your healthcare provider may change your dose depending on your blood sugar test results. If your blood sugar level is not under control, call your healthcare provider. Do not change your dose unless your healthcare provider tells you to. \u2022 If you take too much GLIPIZIDE XL, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room right away. Your healthcare provider may tell you to take GLIPIZIDE XL with other diabetes medicines. Low blood sugar can happen more often when GLIPIZIDE XL is taken with other diabetes medicines. See \" What are the possible side effects of GLIPIZIDE XL? \" \u2022 Check your blood sugar as your healthcare provider tells you to. \u2022 Stay on your prescribed diet and exercise program while taking GLIPIZIDE XL. What should I avoid while taking GLIPIZIDE XL? \u2022 Do not drink alcohol while taking GLIPIZIDE XL. It can increase your chances of getting serious side effects. \u2022 Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how GLIPIZIDE XL affects you. What are the possible side effects of GLIPIZIDE XL? GLIPIZIDE XL can cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 Low blood sugar. GLIPIZIDE XL may cause low blood sugar. Signs and symptoms of low blood sugar may include: \u2022 a cold clammy feeling \u2022 unusual sweating \u2022 dizziness \u2022 weakness \u2022 trembling \u2022 shakiness \u2022 hunger \u2022 fast heartbeat \u2022 headache \u2022 blurred vision \u2022 slurred speech \u2022 tingling in the lips or hands If you have signs or symptoms of low blood sugar, eat or drink something with sugar in it right away. If you do not feel better or your blood sugar level does not go up, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room. The most common side effects of GLIPIZIDE XL include: dizziness, diarrhea, nervousness, tremor, and gas. These are not all the possible side effects of GLIPIZIDE XL.

It is bactericidal for many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as being effective against yeast. Results from in vitro testing are listed below. Sufficient data have been obtained to demonstrate that silver sulfadiazine will inhibit bacteria that are resistant to other antimicrobial agents and that the compound is superior to sulfadiazine. Studies utilizing radioactive micronized silver sulfadiazine, electron microscopy, and biochemical techniques have revealed that the mechanism of action of silver sulfadiazine on bacteria differs from silver nitrate and sodium sulfadiazine. Silver sulfadiazine acts only on the cell wall to produce its bactericidal effect.

Because sulfonamide therapy is known to increase the possibility of kernicterus, silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should not be used on pregnant women approaching or at term, on premature infants, or on newborn infants during the first 2 months of life."], "warnings": ["WARNINGS Absorption of silver sulfadiazine varies depending upon the percent of body surface area and the extent of the tissue damage. Although few have been reported, it is possible that any adverse reaction associated with sulfonamides may occur. Some of the reactions which have been associated with sulfonamides are as follows: blood dyscrasias including agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hemolytic anemia; dermatologic and allergic reactions, including life-threatening cutaneous reactions [Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and exfoliative dermatitis]; gastrointestinal reactions, hepatitis and hepatocellular necrosis; CNS reactions; and toxic nephrosis. There is a potential cross-sensitivity between silver sulfadiazine and other sulfonamides. If allergic reactions attributable to treatment with silver sulfadiazine occur, continuation of therapy must be weighed against the potential hazards of the particular allergic reaction. Fungal proliferation in and below the eschar may occur. However, the incidence of clinically reported fungal superinfection is low. The use of silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% in some cases of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient individuals may be hazardous, as hemolysis may occur."], "precautions": ["PRECAUTIONS General. If hepatic and renal functions become impaired and elimination of the drug decreases accumulation may occur. Discontinuation of silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should be weighed against the therapeutic benefit being achieved. In considering the use of topical proteolytic enzymes in conjunction with Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% the possibility should be noted that silver may inactivate such enzymes. Laboratory Tests. In the treatment of burn wounds involving extensive areas of the body, the serum sulfa concentrations may approach adult therapeutic levels (8 to 12mg %). Therefore, in these patients it would be advisable to monitor serum sulfa concentrations. Renal function should be carefully monitored and the urine should be checked for sulfa crystals. Absorption of the propylene glycol vehicle has been reported to affect serum osmolality, which may affect the interpretation of laboratory tests. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility.

Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with all insulins, including HUMALOG Mix50/50. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life-threatening, or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time, this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of HUMALOG Mix50/50 may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between HUMALOG Mix50/50 and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including HUMALOG Mix50/50. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue HUMALOG Mix50/50; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. HUMALOG Mix50/50 is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to HUMALOG Mix50/50 or any of its excipients [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including HUMALOG Mix50/50, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including HUMALOG Mix50/50, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."], "adverse_reactions": ["6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Adverse reactions observed with HUMALOG Mix50/50 include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, weight gain, edema, pruritus, and rash.

Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies or Postmarketing Reports The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing use of HUMALOG Mix50/50. Because some of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with insulin initiation and glucose control intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. Over the long-term, improved glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Hypersensitivity reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in HUMALOG Mix50/50. Hypokalemia HUMALOG Mix50/50 can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Injection site reactions HUMALOG Mix50/50 can cause local injection site reactions including redness, swelling, or itching at the site of injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of meta-cresol, which is an excipient in HUMALOG Mix50/50. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including HUMALOG Mix50/50, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] in some patients. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site. Medication Errors Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for HUMALOG Mix50/50 have been identified during postapproval use. Peripheral Edema Insulins, including HUMALOG Mix50/50, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulins, including HUMALOG Mix50/50, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form.

There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Pregnant rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin lispro in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis. No adverse effects on embryo/fetal viability or morphology were observed in offspring of rats exposed to insulin lispro at a dose approximately 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit insulin lispro/kg/day. No adverse effects on embryo/fetal development were observed in offspring of rabbits exposed to insulin lispro at doses up to approximately 0.2 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from retrospective studies and meta-analyses do not report an association with insulin lispro and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin lispro is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish or exclude the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size, selection bias, confounding by unmeasured factors, and some lacking comparator groups. Animal Data Animal reproduction studies have not been performed with HUMALOG Mix50/50. However, subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been conducted with insulin lispro (a component of HUMALOG Mix50/50). In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study, female rats were given subcutaneous insulin lispro injections of 1, 5, and 20 units/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, and 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit insulin lispro/kg/day, based on units/body surface area, respectively) from 2 weeks prior to cohabitation through Gestation Day 19. There were no adverse effects on female fertility, implantation, or fetal viability and morphology. However, fetal growth retardation was produced at the 20 units/kg/day-dose as indicated by decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of fetal runts/litter. In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits, insulin lispro doses of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.75 unit/kg/day (0.03, 0.08, and 0.2 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit insulin lispro/kg/day, based on units/body surface area, respectively) were injected subcutaneously on Gestation days 7 through 19. There were no adverse effects on fetal viability, weight, and morphology at any dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Available data from published literature suggests that exogenous human insulin products, including insulin lispro, are transferred into human milk. There are no adverse reactions reported in breastfed infants in the literature. There are no data on the effects of exogenous human insulin products, including insulin lispro, on milk production.

Insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline. Chemically, it is Lys(B28), Pro(B29) human insulin analog and has the empirical formula C 257 H 383 N 65 O 77 S 6 and a molecular weight of 5.808 kDa, both identical to that of human insulin. Humalog Mix50/50 (insulin lispro protamine and insulin lispro) injectable suspension is a mixture of 50% insulin lispro protamine, an intermediate-acting human insulin analog, and 50% insulin lispro, a rapid-acting human insulin analog. Insulin lispro protamine suspension is a suspension of crystals produced from combining insulin lispro and protamine sulfate under appropriate conditions for crystal formation.

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Do not share your needles or syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Supplies needed to give your injection a multiple-dose HUMALOG Mix50/50 vial a U-100 insulin syringe and needle 2 alcohol swabs gauze 1 sharps container for throwing away used needles and syringes. See \u201c Disposing of used needles and syringes \u201d at the end of these instructions. Vial Syringe Preparing your HUMALOG Mix50/50 dose Wash your hands with soap and water. Check the HUMALOG Mix50/50 label to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you use more than 1 type of insulin. HUMALOG Mix50/50 is easier to mix when it is at room temperature. After mixing HUMALOG Mix50/50, inject your dose right away. If you wait to inject your dose, the insulin will need to be mixed again. Always use a new syringe and needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked needles. Do not reuse or share your syringes or needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Step 1: Gently roll the vial between the palms of your hands at least 10 times. Step 2: Gently move the vial up and down (invert) at least 10 times. Mixing is important to make sure you get the right dose. Humalog Mix50/50 should look white and cloudy after mixing. Do not use it if it looks clear or contains any lumps or particles. Step 3: If you are using a new vial, pull off the plastic Protective Cap, but do not remove the Rubber Stopper. Step 4: Wipe the Rubber Stopper with an alcohol swab. Step 5: Remove the Needle Shield from the syringe by pulling the Needle Shield straight off. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. Pull down on the Plunger until the Plunger Tip reaches the line for the number of units for your prescribed dose. (Example Dose: 20 units shown) Step 6: Push the needle through the Rubber Stopper of the vial. Step 7: Push the Plunger all the way in. This puts air into the vial. Step 8: Turn the vial and syringe upside down and slowly pull the Plunger down until the Plunger Tip is a few units past the line for your prescribed dose. (Example Dose: 20 units Plunger Tip is shown at 24 units) If there are air bubbles, tap the syringe gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. Step 9: Slowly push the Plunger up until the Plunger Tip reaches the line for your prescribed dose. Check the syringe to make sure that you have the right dose. (Example Dose: 20 units shown) Step 10: Pull the syringe out of the Rubber Stopper of the vial. Giving your HUMALOG Mix50/50 injection Inject your insulin exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you should pinch the skin before injecting. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Step 11: Choose your injection site. HUMALOG Mix50/50 is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area (abdomen), buttocks, upper legs or upper arms. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab. Let the injection site dry before you inject your dose. Step 12: Insert the needle into your skin. Step 13: Push down on the Plunger to inject your dose. The needle should stay in your skin for at least 5 seconds to make sure you have injected all of your insulin dose. Step 14: Pull the needle out of your skin. If you see blood after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site with a piece of gauze or an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. Do not recap the needle. Recapping the needle can lead to a needle stick injury. Disposing of used needles and syringes Put your used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: - made of a heavy-duty plastic, - can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, - upright and stable during use, - leak-resistant, and - properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

Do not share your HUMALOG Mix50/50 KwikPen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. HUMALOG Mix50/50 KwikPen (\u201cPen\u201d) is a disposable single-patient-use prefilled pen containing 300 units of HUMALOG Mix50/50. You can give yourself more than 1 dose from the Pen. By turning the Dose Knob, you can dial doses from 1 to 60 units in 1 unit increments. If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give yourself more than 1 injection. The Plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. The Plunger will only reach the end of the cartridge when you have used all 300 units in the Pen. People who are blind or have vision problems should not use this Pen without help from a person trained to use the Pen.

Check your Pen to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you use more than 1 type of insulin. Always use a new needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked needles. Do not reuse or share your needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Step 1: Pull the Pen Cap straight off. - Do not remove the Pen Label. Wipe the Rubber Seal with an alcohol swab. - Do not attach the Needle before mixing. Step 2: Gently roll the Pen between your hands at least 10 times. Step 3: Move the Pen up and down (invert) at least 10 times. Mixing by rolling and inverting the Pen is important to make sure you get the right dose. After mixing HUMALOG Mix50/50, inject your dose right away. If you wait to inject your dose, the insulin will need to be mixed again. Step 4: Check the liquid in the Pen. HUMALOG Mix50/50 should look white and cloudy after mixing. Do not use if it looks clear or has any lumps or particles in it. Step 5: Select a new Needle. Pull off the Paper Tab from the Outer Needle Shield. Step 6: Push the capped Needle straight onto the Pen and twist the Needle on until it is tight. Step 7: Pull off the Outer Needle Shield. Do not throw it away. Pull off the Inner Needle Shield and throw it away. Priming your Pen Prime your Pen before each injection. Priming your Pen means removing the air from the Needle and Cartridge that may collect during normal use and ensures that the Pen is working correctly. If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. Step 8: To prime your Pen, turn the Dose Knob to select 2 units. Step 9: Hold your Pen with the Needle pointing up. Tap the Cartridge Holder gently to collect air bubbles at the top. Step 10: Continue holding your Pen with Needle pointing up. Push the Dose Knob in until it stops, and \u201c0\u201d is seen in the Dose Window. Hold the Dose Knob in and count to 5 slowly . You should see insulin at the tip of the Needle. - If you do not see insulin, repeat priming steps 8 to 10, no more than 4 times. - If you still do not see insulin, change the Needle and repeat priming steps 8 to 10. Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect your dose. Selecting your dose You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give more than one injection. - If you need help with dividing up your dose the right way, ask your healthcare provider. - Use a new Needle for each injection and repeat the priming steps. Step 11: Turn the Dose Knob to select the number of units you need to inject. The Dose Indicator should line up with your dose. - The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. - The Dose Knob clicks as you turn it. - Do not dial your dose by counting the clicks. You may dial the wrong dose. This may lead to you getting too much insulin or not enough insulin. - The dose can be corrected by turning the Dose Knob in either direction until the correct dose lines up with the Dose Indicator. - The even numbers (for example, 12) are printed on the dial. - The odd numbers, (for example, 25) after the number 1, are shown as full lines. Always check the number in the Dose Window to make sure you have dialed the correct dose. (Example: 12 units shown in the Dose Window) (Example: 25 units shown in the Dose Window) The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: - inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, or - get a new Pen and inject the full dose. It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you can not inject. Giving your injection Inject your insulin as your healthcare provider has shown you. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Do not try to change your dose while injecting. Step 12: Choose your injection site. HUMALOG Mix50/50 is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs or upper arms. Wipe your skin with an alcohol swab, and let your skin dry before you inject your dose. Step 13: Insert the Needle into your skin. Push the Dose Knob all the way in. Continue to hold the Dose Knob in and slowly count to 5 before removing the Needle. Do not try to inject your insulin by turning the Dose Knob. You will not receive your insulin by turning the Dose Knob. Step 14: Pull the Needle out of your skin. A drop of insulin at the Needle tip is normal. It will not affect your dose. Check the number in the Dose Window. - If you see \u201c0\u201d in the Dose Window, you have received the full amount you dialed. - If you do not see \u201c0\u201d in the Dose Window, do not redial. Insert the Needle into your skin and finish your injection. - If you still do not think you received the full amount you dialed for your injection, do not start over or repeat the injection. Monitor your blood glucose as instructed by your healthcare provider. - If you normally need to give 2 injections for your full dose, be sure to give your second injection. The Plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. If you see blood after you take the Needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of gauze or an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After your injection Step 15: Carefully replace the Outer Needle Shield. Step 16: Unscrew the capped Needle and throw it away (see Disposing of Pens and Needles section). Do not store the Pen with the Needle attached to prevent leaking, blocking the Needle, and air from entering the Pen. Step 17: Replace the Pen Cap by lining up the Cap Clip with the Dose Indicator and pushing straight on. Disposing of Pens and Needles The used Pen may be discarded in your household trash after you have removed the needle. Put your used needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: - made of a heavy-duty plastic, - can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, - upright and stable during use, - leak-resistant, and - properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Storing your Pen Unused Pens Store unused Pens in the refrigerator at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze your insulin. Do not use if HUMALOG Mix50/50 has been frozen. Unused Pens may be used until the expiration date printed on the Label, if the Pen has been kept in the refrigerator. Unused Pens stored at room temperature, up to 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C), should be thrown away after 10 days. In-use Pen Store the Pen you are currently using at room temperature [up to 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C)]. Keep away from heat and light. Throw away the HUMALOG Mix50/50 Pen you are using after 10 days, even if it still has insulin left in it. General information about the safe and effective use of your Pen Keep your Pen and needles out of the reach of children. Do not use your Pen if any part looks broken or damaged. Always carry an extra Pen in case yours is lost or damaged. Troubleshooting If you can not remove the Pen Cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap straight off. If the Dose Knob is hard to push: - Pushing the Dose Knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. - Your Needle may be blocked. Put on a new Needle and prime the Pen. - You may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen.

These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those on multiple anticonvulsants, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease. When Depakote is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. The incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups. Patients with Mitochondrial Disease: There is an increased risk of valproate-induced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by DNA mutations of the mitochondrial DNA Polymerase \u03b3 (POLG) gene (e.g. Alpers Huttenlocher Syndrome). Depakote is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, Depakote should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with Depakote for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver testing. POLG mutation screening should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Fetal Risk Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida). In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores and neurodevelopmental disorders following in utero exposure. Valproate is therefore contraindicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in pregnant women and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such situations, effective contraception should be used [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 )]. A Medication Guide describing the risks of valproate is available for patients [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Pancreatitis Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with a rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Cases have been reported shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. WARNING: LIFE THREATENING ADVERSE REACTIONS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning . Hepatotoxicity, including fatalities, usually during the first 6 months of treatment. Children under the age of two years and patients with mitochondrial disorders are at higher risk. Monitor patients closely, and perform serum liver testing prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter ( 5.1 ) Fetal Risk, particularly neural tube defects, other major malformations, and decreased IQ ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) Pancreatitis, including fatal hemorrhagic cases ( 5.5 )"], "indications_and_usage": ["1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Depakote is an anti-epileptic drug indicated for: Treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder ( 1.1 ) Monotherapy and adjunctive therapy of complex partial seizures and simple and complex absence seizures; adjunctive therapy in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures ( 1.2 ) Prophylaxis of migraine headaches ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Mania Depakote (divalproex sodium) is a valproate and is indicated for the treatment of the manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Typical symptoms of mania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas, grandiosity, poor judgment, aggressiveness, and possible hostility. The efficacy of Depakote was established in 3-week trials with patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for bipolar disorder who were hospitalized for acute mania [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Depakote for long-term use in mania, i.e., more than 3 weeks, has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, healthcare providers who elect to use Depakote for extended periods should continually reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. 1.2 Epilepsy Depakote is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of patients with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures. Depakote is also indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures, and adjunctively in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures. Simple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness accompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs. Complex absence is the term used when other signs are also present. 1.3 Migraine Depakote is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches. There is no evidence that Depakote is useful in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. 1.4 Important Limitations Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations, which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] . For prophylaxis of migraine headaches, Depakote is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] ."], "dosage_and_administration": ["2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Depakote tablets are intended for oral administration. Depakote tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be crushed or chewed. Patients should be informed to take Depakote every day as prescribed. If a dose is missed it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. If a dose is skipped, the patient should not double the next dose. Depakote is administered orally in divided doses. Depakote should be swallowed whole and should not be crushed or chewed ( 2.1 , 2.2 ). Mania: Initial dose is 750 mg daily, increasing as rapidly as possible to achieve therapeutic response or desired plasma level ( 2.1 ). The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day ( 2.1 , 2.2 ). Complex Partial Seizures: Start at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at 1 week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day to achieve optimal clinical response; if response is not satisfactory, check valproate plasma level; see full prescribing information for conversion to monotherapy ( 2.2 ). The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day ( 2.1 , 2.2 ). Absence Seizures: Start at 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at 1 week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizure control or limiting side effects ( 2.2 ). The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day ( 2.1 , 2.2 ). Migraine: The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily, thereafter increasing to a maximum of 1,000 mg/day as needed ( 2.3 ). 2.1 Mania Depakote tablets are administered orally. The recommended initial dose is 750 mg daily in divided doses. The dose should be increased as rapidly as possible to achieve the lowest therapeutic dose which produces the desired clinical effect or the desired range of plasma concentrations. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of acute mania, patients were dosed to a clinical response with a trough plasma concentration between 50 and 125 mcg/mL. Maximum concentrations were generally achieved within 14 days. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer term management of a patient who improves during Depakote treatment of an acute manic episode. While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no data to support the benefits of Depakote in such longer-term treatment. Although there are no efficacy data that specifically address longer-term antimanic treatment with Depakote, the safety of Depakote in long-term use is supported by data from record reviews involving approximately 360 patients treated with Depakote for greater than 3 months. 2.2 Epilepsy Depakote tablets are administered orally. Depakote is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. As the Depakote dosage is titrated upward, concentrations of clonazepam, diazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, tolbutamide, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ] . Complex Partial Seizures For adults and children 10 years of age or older. Monotherapy (Initial Therapy) Depakote has not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males. The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions. Conversion to Monotherapy Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50-100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Depakote therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency. Adjunctive Therapy Depakote may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses. In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] . However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] . Simple and Complex Absence Seizures The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses. A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentrations for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . As the Depakote dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ] . Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life. In epileptic patients previously receiving valproic acid therapy, Depakote tablets should be initiated at the same daily dose and dosing schedule. After the patient is stabilized on Depakote tablets, a dosing schedule of two or three times a day may be elected in selected patients. 2.3 Migraine Depakote is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults. Depakote tablets are administered orally. The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily. Some patients may benefit from doses up to 1,000 mg/day. In the clinical trials, there was no evidence that higher doses led to greater efficacy. 2.4 General Dosing Advice Dosing in Elderly Patients Due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Dose-Related Adverse Reactions The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of \u2265 110 mcg/mL (females) or \u2265 135 mcg/mL (males) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] . The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions. G.I. Irritation Patients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level. 2.5 Dosing in Patients Taking Rufinamide Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."], "dosage_forms_and_strengths": ["3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Depakote tablets (divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets) are supplied as: 125 mg salmon pink-colored tablets with the \u201ca\u201d logo and the code NT Tablets: 125 mg ( 3 )"], "contraindications": ["4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Depakote should not be administered to patients with hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] .

Depakote dosage should be increased slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity General Information on Hepatotoxicity Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months of valproate therapy. However, healthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination. Caution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of hepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk. See below, \u201cPatients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease.\u201d Experience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions. When Depakote is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. In progressively older patient groups experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably. Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease Depakote is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . Valproate-induced acute liver failure and liver-related deaths have been reported in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by mutations in the gene for mitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3 (POLG) (e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) at a higher rate than those without these syndromes. Most of the reported cases of liver failure in patients with these syndromes have been identified in children and adolescents. POLG-related disorders should be suspected in patients with a family history or suggestive symptoms of a POLG-related disorder, including but not limited to unexplained encephalopathy, refractory epilepsy (focal, myoclonic), status epilepticus at presentation, developmental delays, psychomotor regression, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, myopathy cerebellar ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, or complicated migraine with occipital aura. POLG mutation testing should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice for the diagnostic evaluation of such disorders. The A467T and W748S mutations are present in approximately 2/3 of patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders. In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, Depakote should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with Depakote for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver test monitoring. The drug should be discontinued immediately in the presence of significant hepatic dysfunction, suspected or apparent. In some cases, hepatic dysfunction has progressed in spite of discontinuation of drug [see Boxed Warning and Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.2 Structural Birth Defects Valproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure monotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . 5.3 Decreased IQ Following in utero Exposure Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed in utero to either another antiepileptic drug or to no antiepileptic drugs. The largest of these studies 1 is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C.I. 94-101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I. 105\u2013110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C.I. 102\u2013108]), and phenytoin (108 [95% C.I. 104\u2013112]). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed. Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero can cause decreased IQ in children. In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . 5.4 Use in Women of Childbearing Potential Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, and major congenital malformations (including neural tube defects), which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . Women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Women of childbearing potential should be counseled regularly regarding the relative risks and benefits of valproate use during pregnancy. This is especially important for women planning a pregnancy and for girls at the onset of puberty; alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . To prevent major seizures, valproate should not be discontinued abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate. 5.5 Pancreatitis Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Some cases have occurred shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. The rate based upon the reported cases exceeds that expected in the general population and there have been cases in which pancreatitis recurred after rechallenge with valproate. In clinical trials, there were 2 cases of pancreatitis without alternative etiology in 2,416 patients, representing 1,044 patient-years experience. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, Depakote should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.6 Urea Cycle Disorders Depakote is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders (UCD). Hyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of valproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, a group of uncommon genetic abnormalities, particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Prior to the initiation of Depakote therapy, evaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients: 1) those with a history of unexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with a protein load, pregnancy-related or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma ammonia or glutamine; 2) those with cyclical vomiting and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability, ataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance; 3) those with a family history of UCD or a family history of unexplained infant deaths (particularly males); 4) those with other signs or symptoms of UCD. Patients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving valproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) ] . 5.7 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Depakote, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing Depakote or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. 5.8 Bleeding and Other Hematopoietic Disorders Valproate is associated with dose-related thrombocytopenia. In a clinical trial of valproate as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients (27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets \u2264 75 x 10 9 /L. Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts to normal. In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment. In this study, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of \u2265 110 mcg/mL (females) or \u2265 135 mcg/mL (males). The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse effects. Valproate use has also been associated with decreases in other cell lines and myelodysplasia. Because of reports of cytopenias, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters, (e.g., low fibrinogen, coagulation factor deficiencies, acquired von Willebrand\u2019s disease), measurements of complete blood counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals. It is recommended that patients receiving Depakote be monitored for blood counts and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery and during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy. 5.9 Hyperammonemia Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured. Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) ] . If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued. Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 , 5.10 ) ] . Asymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels. If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered. 5.10 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy Associated with Concomitant Topiramate Use Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting. Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) ] . In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug. This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, an interaction of topiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 , 5.9 ) ] . 5.11 Hypothermia Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to <35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F), has been reported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate with valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) ] . Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels. 5.12 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking valproate. DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Valproate should be discontinued and not be resumed if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.13 Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics Carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) may reduce serum valproate concentrations to subtherapeutic levels, resulting in loss of seizure control. Serum valproate concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproate concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . 5.14 Somnolence in the Elderly In a double-blind, multicenter trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia (mean age = 83 years), doses were increased by 125 mg/day to a target dose of 20 mg/kg/day. A significantly higher proportion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo, and although not statistically significant, there was a higher proportion of patients with dehydration. Discontinuations for somnolence were also significantly higher than with placebo. In some patients with somnolence (approximately one-half), there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss. There was a trend for the patients who experienced these events to have a lower baseline albumin concentration, lower valproate clearance, and a higher BUN. In elderly patients, dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ] . 5.15 Monitoring: Drug Plasma Concentration Since valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme induction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] . 5.16 Effect on Ketone and Thyroid Function Tests Valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a keto-metabolite which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test. There have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate. The clinical significance of these is unknown. 5.17 Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication There are in vitro studies that suggest valproate stimulates the replication of the HIV and CMV viruses under certain experimental conditions. The clinical consequence, if any, is not known. Additionally, the relevance of these in vitro findings is uncertain for patients receiving maximally suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, these data should be borne in mind when interpreting the results from regular monitoring of the viral load in HIV infected patients receiving valproate or when following CMV infected patients clinically. 5.18 Medication Residue in the Stool There have been rare reports of medication residue in the stool. Some patients have had anatomic (including ileostomy or colostomy) or functional gastrointestinal disorders with shortened GI transit times. In some reports, medication residues have occurred in the context of diarrhea. It is recommended that plasma valproate levels be checked in patients who experience medication residue in the stool, and patients\u2019 clinical condition should be monitored.

Most common adverse reactions (reported >5%) are abdominal pain, accidental injury, alopecia, amblyopia/blurred vision, amnesia, anorexia, asthenia, ataxia, back pain, bronchitis, constipation, depression, diarrhea, diplopia, dizziness, dyspepsia, dyspnea, ecchymosis, emotional lability, fever, flu syndrome, headache, increased appetite, infection, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, nystagmus, peripheral edema, pharyngitis, rash, rhinitis, somnolence, thinking abnormal, thrombocytopenia, tinnitus, tremor, vomiting, weight gain, weight loss ( 6.1 , 6.2 , 6.3 ). The safety and tolerability of valproate in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults ( 8.4 ).

The adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity, but sometimes were serious enough to interrupt treatment. In clinical trials, the rates of premature termination due to intolerance were not statistically different between placebo, Depakote, and lithium carbonate. A total of 4%, 8% and 11% of patients discontinued therapy due to intolerance in the placebo, Depakote, and lithium carbonate groups, respectively. Table 2 summarizes those adverse reactions reported for patients in these trials where the incidence rate in the Depakote-treated group was greater than 5% and greater than the placebo incidence, or where the incidence in the Depakote-treated group was statistically significantly greater than the placebo group. Vomiting was the only reaction that was reported by significantly (p \u2264 0.05) more patients receiving Depakote compared to placebo. Table 2.

The following additional adverse reactions were reported by greater than 1% but not more than 5% of the 89 Depakote-treated patients in controlled clinical trials: Body as a Whole: Chest pain, chills, chills and fever, fever, neck pain, neck rigidity. Cardiovascular System: Hypertension, hypotension, palpitations, postural hypotension, tachycardia, vasodilation. Digestive System: Anorexia, fecal incontinence, flatulence, gastroenteritis, glossitis, periodontal abscess. Hemic and Lymphatic System: Ecchymosis. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Edema, peripheral edema. Musculoskeletal System: Arthralgia, arthrosis, leg cramps, twitching. Nervous System: Abnormal dreams, abnormal gait, agitation, ataxia, catatonic reaction, confusion, depression, diplopia, dysarthria, hallucinations, hypertonia, hypokinesia, insomnia, paresthesia, reflexes increased, tardive dyskinesia, thinking abnormalities, vertigo.

Special Senses: Amblyopia, conjunctivitis, deafness, dry eyes, ear pain, eye pain, tinnitus. Urogenital System: Dysmenorrhea, dysuria, urinary incontinence. 6.2 Epilepsy Based on a placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive therapy for treatment of complex partial seizures, Depakote was generally well tolerated with most adverse reactions rated as mild to moderate in severity. Intolerance was the primary reason for discontinuation in the Depakote-treated patients (6%), compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions which were reported by \u2265 5% of Depakote-treated patients and for which the incidence was greater than in the placebo group, in the placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive therapy for treatment of complex partial seizures. Since patients were also treated with other antiepilepsy drugs, it is not possible, in most cases, to determine whether the following adverse reactions can be ascribed to Depakote alone, or the combination of Depakote and other antiepilepsy drugs.

Since patients were being titrated off another antiepilepsy drug during the first portion of the trial, it is not possible, in many cases, to determine whether the following adverse reactions can be ascribed to Depakote alone, or the combination of valproate and other antiepilepsy drugs.

Urogenital System: Urinary incontinence, vaginitis, dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, urinary frequency. 6.3 Migraine Based on two placebo-controlled clinical trials and their long term extension, valproate was generally well tolerated with most adverse reactions rated as mild to moderate in severity. Of the 202 patients exposed to valproate in the placebo-controlled trials, 17% discontinued for intolerance. This is compared to a rate of 5% for the 81 placebo patients. Including the long term extension study, the adverse reactions reported as the primary reason for discontinuation by \u2265 1% of 248 valproate-treated patients were alopecia (6%), nausea and/or vomiting (5%), weight gain (2%), tremor (2%), somnolence (1%), elevated SGOT and/or SGPT (1%), and depression (1%). Table 5 includes those adverse reactions reported for patients in the placebo-controlled trials where the incidence rate in the Depakote-treated group was greater than 5% and was greater than that for placebo patients.

Urogenital System: Cystitis, metrorrhagia, and vaginal hemorrhage. 6.4 Post m arketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Depakote. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Dermatologic: Hair texture changes, hair color changes, photosensitivity, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, nail and nail bed disorders, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Psychiatric: Emotional upset, psychosis, aggression, psychomotor hyperactivity, hostility, disturbance in attention, learning disorder, and behavioral deterioration.

There have been reports of acute or subacute encephalopathy in the absence of elevated ammonia levels, elevated valproate levels, or neuroimaging changes. The encephalopathy reversed partially or fully after valproate discontinuation. Musculoskeletal: Fractures, decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and weakness. Hematologic: Relative lymphocytosis, macrocytosis, leukopenia, anemia including macrocytic with or without folate deficiency, bone marrow suppression, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and acute intermittent porphyria.

Therefore increased monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations and dosage adjustment are indicated whenever enzyme-inducing or inhibiting drugs are introduced or withdrawn ( 7.1 ) Aspirin, carbapenem antibiotics, estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives, methotrexate: Monitoring of valproate concentrations is recommended ( 7.1 ) Co-administration of valproate can affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs (e.g. diazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, phenytoin) by inhibiting their metabolism or protein binding displacement ( 7.2 ) Patients stabilized on rufinamide should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to clinically effective dose ( 7.2 ) Dosage adjustment of amitriptyline/nortriptyline, propofol, warfarin, and zidovudine may be necessary if used concomitantly with Depakote ( 7.2 ) Topiramate: Hyperammonemia and encephalopathy ( 5.10 , 7.3 ) Cannabidiol: ALT and/or AST elevation ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Effects of Co-Administered Drugs on Valproate Clearance Drugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate levels of glucuronosyltransferases (such as ritonavir), may increase the clearance of valproate. For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate. Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs. In contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g., antidepressants, may be expected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated oxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and beta-oxidation. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn. The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly prescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics. The list is not exhaustive nor could it be, since new interactions are continuously being reported. Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed Aspirin A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n=6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate. Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone. The \u03b2-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin. Caution should be observed if valproate and aspirin are to be co-administered. Carbapenem Antibiotics A clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction is not well understood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ) ] . Estrogen-Containing Hormonal Contraceptives Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives may increase the clearance of valproate, which may result in decreased concentration of valproate and potentially increased seizure frequency. Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing estrogen containing products. Felbamate A study involving the co-administration of 1,200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with epilepsy (n=10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 to 115 mcg/mL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase). A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated. Methotrexate Methotrexate may decrease serum valproate levels and potentially result in increased frequency of seizures or bipolar symptoms. Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing methotrexate and adjust valproate dosage, if necessary. Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate. Valproate dosage adjustment may be necessary when it is co-administered with rifampin. 7.2 Effects of Valproate on Other Drugs Valproate has been found to be a weak inhibitor of some P450 isozymes, epoxide hydrase, and glucuronosyltransferases. The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of valproate co-administration on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of several commonly prescribed medications. The list is not exhaustive, since new interactions are continuously being reported. Drugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed Amitriptyline/Nortriptyline Administration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5 females) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21% decrease in plasma clearance of amitriptyline and a 34% decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline. Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received. Concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity. Monitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered for patients taking valproate concomitantly with amitriptyline. Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate. Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients. Clonazepam The concomitant use of valproate and clonazepam may induce absence status in patients with a history of absence type seizures. Diazepam Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism. Co-administration of valproate (1,500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90% in healthy volunteers (n=6). Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate. The elimination half-life of diazepam remained unchanged upon addition of valproate. Ethosuximide Valproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide. Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n=6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone. Patients receiving valproate and ethosuximide, especially along with other anticonvulsants, should be monitored for alterations in serum concentrations of both drugs. Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase). The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate. Serious skin reactions (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported with concomitant lamotrigine and valproate administration. See lamotrigine package insert for details on lamotrigine dosing with concomitant valproate administration. Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital. Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n=6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose). The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate. There is evidence for severe CNS depression, with or without significant elevations of barbiturate or valproate serum concentrations. All patients receiving concomitant barbiturate therapy should be closely monitored for neurological toxicity. Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate. Primidone, which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may be involved in a similar interaction with valproate. Phenytoin Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism. Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n=7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin. Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of valproate. Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%. In patients with epilepsy, there have been reports of breakthrough seizures occurring with the combination of valproate and phenytoin. The dosage of phenytoin should be adjusted as required by the clinical situation. Propofol The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol. Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate. Monitor patients closely for signs of increased sedation or cardiorespiratory depression. Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate. Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate). Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ] . Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults). Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate. The clinical relevance of this displacement is unknown. Warfarin In an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%. The therapeutic relevance of this is unknown; however, coagulation tests should be monitored if valproate therapy is instituted in patients taking anticoagulants. Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected. 7.3 Topiramate Concomitant administration of valproate and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 , 5.9 , 5.10 ) ] . Concomitant administration of topiramate with valproate has also been associated with hypothermia in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. It may be prudent to examine blood ammonia levels in patients in whom the onset of hypothermia has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 , 5.11 ) ] . 7.4 Cannabidiol Concomitant administration of valproate and cannabidiol has been associated with an increased risk of ALT and/or AST elevation. This has been manageable by dose reduction or, in more severe cases, by discontinuation of one or both drugs. Liver function, including serum transaminase and total bilirubin levels, should be monitored during concomitant treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] ."], "use_in_specific_populations": ["8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Depakote can cause congenital malformations including neural tube defects, decreased IQ, and neurodevelopmental disorders ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 8.1 ) Pediatric: Children under the age of two years are at considerably higher risk of fatal hepatotoxicity ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Geriatric: Reduce starting dose; increase dosage more slowly; monitor fluid and nutritional intake, and somnolence ( 5.14 , 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Depakote, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking Depakote during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling toll-free 1-888-233-2334 or visiting the website, http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. This must be done by the patient herself. Risk Summary For use in prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . For use in epilepsy or bipolar disorder, valproate should not be used to treat women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) ] . Women with epilepsy who become pregnant while taking valproate should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects including spina bifida, but also malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects including oral clefts, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). This risk is dose-dependent; however, a threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established. In utero exposure to valproate may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss. Valproate polytherapy with other AEDs has been associated with an increased frequency of congenital malformations compared with AED monotherapy. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester; however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has been shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who used other anti-seizure monotherapies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Data (Human) ] . Epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores and a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children exposed to either another AED in utero or to no AEDs in utero [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Data (Human) ] . An observational study has suggested that exposure to valproate products during pregnancy increases the risk of autism spectrum disorders [see Data (Human) ] . In animal studies, valproate administration during pregnancy resulted in fetal structural malformations similar to those seen in humans and neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring at clinically relevant doses [see Data (Animal) ] . There have been reports of hypoglycemia in neonates and fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy. Pregnant women taking valproate may develop hepatic failure or clotting abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and/or decrease in other coagulation factors, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate including death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.8 ) ] . Available prenatal diagnostic testing to detect neural tube and other defects should be offered to pregnant women using valproate. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.4 ) ] . All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk To prevent major seizures, women with epilepsy should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Even minor seizures may pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] . However, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy in individual cases if the seizure disorder severity and frequency do not pose a serious threat to the patient. Maternal adverse reactions Pregnant women taking valproate may develop clotting abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and/or decrease in other coagulation factors, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate including death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] . If valproate is used in pregnancy, the clotting parameters should be monitored carefully in the mother. If abnormal in the mother, then these parameters should also be monitored in the neonate. Patients taking valproate may develop hepatic failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . Fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants exposed to valproate in utero have also been reported following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy. Hypoglycemia has been reported in neonates whose mothers have taken valproate during pregnancy. Data Human Neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities There is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating that exposure to valproate in utero increases the risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities. Based on published data from the CDC\u2019s National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spina bifida in the general population is about 0.06 to 0.07% (6 to 7 in 10,000 births) compared to the risk following in utero valproate exposure estimated to be approximately 1 to 2% (100 to 200 in 10,000 births). The NAAED Pregnancy Registry has reported a major malformation rate of 9-11% in the offspring of women exposed to an average of 1,000 mg/day of valproate monotherapy during pregnancy. These data show an up to a five-fold increased risk for any major malformation following valproate exposure in utero compared to the risk following exposure in utero to other AEDs taken as monotherapy. The major congenital malformations included cases of neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, craniofacial defects (e.g., oral clefts, craniosynostosis), hypospadias, limb malformations (e.g., clubfoot, polydactyly), and other malformations of varying severity involving other body systems [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] . Effect on IQ and neurodevelopmental effects Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another AED in utero or to no AEDs in utero . The largest of these studies 1 is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C.I. 94-101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other anti-epileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I. 105\u2013110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C.I. 102\u2013108]) and phenytoin (108 [95% C.I. 104\u2013112]). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to AEDs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] . Although the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports a causal association between valproate exposure in utero and subsequent adverse effects on neurodevelopment, including increases in autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). An observational study has suggested that exposure to valproate products during pregnancy increases the risk of autism spectrum disorders. In this study, children born to mothers who had used valproate products during pregnancy had 2.9 times the risk (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-4.9) of developing autism spectrum disorders compared to children born to mothers not exposed to valproate products during pregnancy. The absolute risks for autism spectrum disorders were 4.4% (95% CI: 2.6%-7.5%) in valproate-exposed children and 1.5% (95% CI: 1.5%-1.6%) in children not exposed to valproate products. Another observational study found that children who were exposed to valproate in utero had an increased risk of ADHD (adjusted HR 1.48; 95% CI, 1.09-2.00) compared with the unexposed children. Because these studies were observational in nature, conclusions regarding a causal association between in utero valproate exposure and an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder and ADHD cannot be considered definitive. Other There are published case reports of fatal hepatic failure in offspring of women who used valproate during pregnancy. Animal In developmental toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, increased rates of fetal structural abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death occurred following administration of valproate to pregnant animals during organogenesis at clinically relevant doses (calculated on a body surface area [mg/m 2 ] basis). Valproate induced malformations of multiple organ systems, including skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital defects. In mice, in addition to other malformations, fetal neural tube defects have been reported following valproate administration during critical periods of organogenesis, and the teratogenic response correlated with peak maternal drug levels. Behavioral abnormalities (including cognitive, locomotor, and social interaction deficits) and brain histopathological changes have also been reported in mice and rat offspring exposed prenatally to clinically relevant doses of valproate. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Valproate is excreted in human milk. Data in the published literature describe the presence of valproate in human milk (range: 0.4 mcg/mL to 3.9 mcg/mL), corresponding to 1% to 10% of maternal serum levels. Valproate serum concentrations collected from breastfed infants aged 3 days postnatal to 12 weeks following delivery ranged from 0.7 mcg/mL to 4 mcg/mL, which were 1% to 6% of maternal serum valproate levels. A published study in children up to six years of age did not report adverse developmental or cognitive effects following exposure to valproate via breast milk [see Data (Human) ] . There are no data to assess the effects of Depakote on milk production or excretion. Clinical Considerations The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Depakote and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Depakote or from the underlying maternal condition. Monitor the breastfed infant for signs of liver damage including jaundice and unusual bruising or bleeding. There have been reports of hepatic failure and clotting abnormalities in offspring of women who used valproate during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . Data Human In a published study, breast milk and maternal blood samples were obtained from 11 epilepsy patients taking valproate at doses ranging from 300 mg/day to 2,400 mg/day on postnatal days 3 to 6. In 4 patients who were taking valproate only, breast milk contained an average valproate concentration of 1.8 mcg/mL (range: 1.1 mcg/mL to 2.2 mcg/mL), which corresponded to 4.8% of the maternal plasma concentration (range: 2.7% to 7.4%). Across all patients (7 of whom were taking other AEDs concomitantly), similar results were obtained for breast milk concentration (1.8 mcg/mL, range: 0.4 mcg/mL to 3.9 mcg/mL) and maternal plasma ratio (5.1%, range: 1.3% to 9.6%). A published study of 6 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs measured serum valproate levels during maternal treatment for bipolar disorder (750 mg/day or 1,000 mg/day). None of the mothers received valproate during pregnancy, and infants were aged from 4 weeks to 19 weeks at the time of evaluation. Infant serum levels ranged from 0.7 mcg/mL to 1.5 mcg/mL. With maternal serum valproate levels near or within the therapeutic range, infant exposure was 0.9% to 2.3% of maternal levels. Similarly, in 2 published case reports with maternal doses of 500 mg/day or 750 mg/day during breastfeeding of infants aged 3 months and 1 month, infant exposure was 1.5% and 6% that of the mother, respectively. A prospective observational multicenter study evaluated the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of AED use on children. Pregnant women receiving monotherapy for epilepsy were enrolled with assessments of their children at ages 3 years and 6 years. Mothers continued AED therapy during the breastfeeding period. Adjusted IQs measured at 3 years for breastfed and non-breastfed children were 93 (n=11) and 90 (n=24), respectively. At 6 years, the scores for breastfed and non-breastfed children were 106 (n=11) and 94 (n=25), respectively (p=0.04). For other cognitive domains evaluated at 6 years, no adverse cognitive effects of continued exposure to an AED (including valproate) via breast milk were observed. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while taking valproate [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . Infertility There have been reports of male infertility coincident with valproate therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 ) ] . In animal studies, oral administration of valproate at clinically relevant doses resulted in adverse reproductive effects in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Experience has indicated that pediatric patients under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . When Depakote is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Above the age of 2 years, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups. Younger children, especially those receiving enzyme-inducing drugs, will require larger maintenance doses to attain targeted total and unbound valproate concentrations. Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mL/min/kg) than do adults. Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults. The variability in free fraction limits the clinical usefulness of monitoring total serum valproic acid concentrations. Interpretation of valproic acid concentrations in children should include consideration of factors that affect hepatic metabolism and protein binding. Pediatric Clinical Trials Depakote was studied in seven pediatric clinical trials. Two of the pediatric studies were double-blinded placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of Depakote ER for the indications of mania (150 patients aged 10 to 17 years, 76 of whom were on Depakote ER) and migraine (304 patients aged 12 to 17 years, 231 of whom were on Depakote ER). Efficacy was not established for either the treatment of migraine or the treatment of mania. The most common drug-related adverse reactions (reported >5% and twice the rate of placebo) reported in the controlled pediatric mania study were nausea, upper abdominal pain, somnolence, increased ammonia, gastritis and rash. The remaining five trials were long term safety studies. Two six-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of Depakote ER for the indication of mania (292 patients aged 10 to 17 years). Two twelve-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of Depakote ER for the indication of migraine (353 patients aged 12 to 17 years). One twelve-month study was conducted to evaluate the safety of Depakote Sprinkle Capsules in the indication of partial seizures (169 patients aged 3 to 10 years). In these seven clinical trials, the safety and tolerability of Depakote in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] . Juvenile Animal Toxicology In studies of valproate in immature animals, toxic effects not observed in adult animals included retinal dysplasia in rats treated during the neonatal period (from postnatal day 4) and nephrotoxicity in rats treated during the neonatal and juvenile (from postnatal day 14) periods. The no-effect dose for these findings was less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.5 Geriatric Use No patients above the age of 65 years were enrolled in double-blind prospective clinical trials of mania associated with bipolar illness. In a case review study of 583 patients, 72 patients (12%) were greater than 65 years of age. A higher percentage of patients above 65 years of age reported accidental injury, infection, pain, somnolence, and tremor. Discontinuation of valproate was occasionally associated with the latter two events. It is not clear whether these events indicate additional risk or whether they result from preexisting medical illness and concomitant medication use among these patients. A study of elderly patients with dementia revealed drug related somnolence and discontinuation for somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ) ] . The starting dose should be reduced in these patients, and dosage reductions or discontinuation should be considered in patients with excessive somnolence [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ] . There is insufficient information available to discern the safety and effectiveness of valproate for the prophylaxis of migraines in patients over 65."], "pregnancy": ["8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Depakote, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking Depakote during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling toll-free 1-888-233-2334 or visiting the website, http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. This must be done by the patient herself. Risk Summary For use in prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . For use in epilepsy or bipolar disorder, valproate should not be used to treat women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) ] . Women with epilepsy who become pregnant while taking valproate should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects including spina bifida, but also malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects including oral clefts, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). This risk is dose-dependent; however, a threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established. In utero exposure to valproate may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss. Valproate polytherapy with other AEDs has been associated with an increased frequency of congenital malformations compared with AED monotherapy. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester; however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has been shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who used other anti-seizure monotherapies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Data (Human) ] . Epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores and a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children exposed to either another AED in utero or to no AEDs in utero [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Data (Human) ] . An observational study has suggested that exposure to valproate products during pregnancy increases the risk of autism spectrum disorders [see Data (Human) ] . In animal studies, valproate administration during pregnancy resulted in fetal structural malformations similar to those seen in humans and neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring at clinically relevant doses [see Data (Animal) ] . There have been reports of hypoglycemia in neonates and fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy. Pregnant women taking valproate may develop hepatic failure or clotting abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and/or decrease in other coagulation factors, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate including death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.8 ) ] . Available prenatal diagnostic testing to detect neural tube and other defects should be offered to pregnant women using valproate. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.4 ) ] . All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk To prevent major seizures, women with epilepsy should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Even minor seizures may pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] . However, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy in individual cases if the seizure disorder severity and frequency do not pose a serious threat to the patient. Maternal adverse reactions Pregnant women taking valproate may develop clotting abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and/or decrease in other coagulation factors, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate including death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] . If valproate is used in pregnancy, the clotting parameters should be monitored carefully in the mother. If abnormal in the mother, then these parameters should also be monitored in the neonate. Patients taking valproate may develop hepatic failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . Fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants exposed to valproate in utero have also been reported following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy. Hypoglycemia has been reported in neonates whose mothers have taken valproate during pregnancy. Data Human Neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities There is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating that exposure to valproate in utero increases the risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities. Based on published data from the CDC\u2019s National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spina bifida in the general population is about 0.06 to 0.07% (6 to 7 in 10,000 births) compared to the risk following in utero valproate exposure estimated to be approximately 1 to 2% (100 to 200 in 10,000 births). The NAAED Pregnancy Registry has reported a major malformation rate of 9-11% in the offspring of women exposed to an average of 1,000 mg/day of valproate monotherapy during pregnancy. These data show an up to a five-fold increased risk for any major malformation following valproate exposure in utero compared to the risk following exposure in utero to other AEDs taken as monotherapy. The major congenital malformations included cases of neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, craniofacial defects (e.g., oral clefts, craniosynostosis), hypospadias, limb malformations (e.g., clubfoot, polydactyly), and other malformations of varying severity involving other body systems [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] . Effect on IQ and neurodevelopmental effects Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another AED in utero or to no AEDs in utero . The largest of these studies 1 is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C.I. 94-101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other anti-epileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I. 105\u2013110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C.I. 102\u2013108]) and phenytoin (108 [95% C.I. 104\u2013112]). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to AEDs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] . Although the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports a causal association between valproate exposure in utero and subsequent adverse effects on neurodevelopment, including increases in autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). An observational study has suggested that exposure to valproate products during pregnancy increases the risk of autism spectrum disorders. In this study, children born to mothers who had used valproate products during pregnancy had 2.9 times the risk (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-4.9) of developing autism spectrum disorders compared to children born to mothers not exposed to valproate products during pregnancy. The absolute risks for autism spectrum disorders were 4.4% (95% CI: 2.6%-7.5%) in valproate-exposed children and 1.5% (95% CI: 1.5%-1.6%) in children not exposed to valproate products. Another observational study found that children who were exposed to valproate in utero had an increased risk of ADHD (adjusted HR 1.48; 95% CI, 1.09-2.00) compared with the unexposed children. Because these studies were observational in nature, conclusions regarding a causal association between in utero valproate exposure and an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder and ADHD cannot be considered definitive. Other There are published case reports of fatal hepatic failure in offspring of women who used valproate during pregnancy. Animal In developmental toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, increased rates of fetal structural abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death occurred following administration of valproate to pregnant animals during organogenesis at clinically relevant doses (calculated on a body surface area [mg/m 2 ] basis). Valproate induced malformations of multiple organ systems, including skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital defects. In mice, in addition to other malformations, fetal neural tube defects have been reported following valproate administration during critical periods of organogenesis, and the teratogenic response correlated with peak maternal drug levels. Behavioral abnormalities (including cognitive, locomotor, and social interaction deficits) and brain histopathological changes have also been reported in mice and rat offspring exposed prenatally to clinically relevant doses of valproate."], "pediatric_use": ["8.4 Pediatric Use Experience has indicated that pediatric patients under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] .

Depakote tablets are for oral administration. Depakote tablets are supplied in three dosage strengths containing divalproex sodium equivalent to 125 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg of valproic acid.

The mechanisms by which valproate exerts its therapeutic effects have not been established. It has been suggested that its activity in epilepsy is related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The relationship between plasma concentration and clinical response is not well documented. One contributing factor is the nonlinear, concentration dependent protein binding of valproate which affects the clearance of the drug. Thus, monitoring of total serum valproate cannot provide a reliable index of the bioactive valproate species. For example, because the plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent, the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Higher than expected free fractions occur in the elderly, in hyperlipidemic patients, and in patients with hepatic and renal diseases. Epilepsy The therapeutic range in epilepsy is commonly considered to be 50 to 100 mcg/mL of total valproate, although some patients may be controlled with lower or higher plasma concentrations. Mania In placebo-controlled clinical trials of acute mania, patients were dosed to clinical response with trough plasma concentrations between 50 and 125 mcg/mL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption/Bioavailability Equivalent oral doses of Depakote (divalproex sodium) products and valproic acid capsules deliver equivalent quantities of valproate ion systemically. Although the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation administered (liquid, solid, or sprinkle), conditions of use (e.g., fasting or postprandial) and the method of administration (e.g., whether the contents of the capsule are sprinkled on food or the capsule is taken intact), these differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy. However, it is possible that differences among the various valproate products in T max and C max could be important upon initiation of treatment. For example, in single dose studies, the effect of feeding had a greater influence on the rate of absorption of the tablet (increase in T max from 4 to 8 hours) than on the absorption of the sprinkle capsules (increase in T max from 3.3 to 4.8 hours). While the absorption rate from the G.I. tract and fluctuation in valproate plasma concentrations vary with dosing regimen and formulation, the efficacy of valproate as an anticonvulsant in chronic use is unlikely to be affected. Experience employing dosing regimens from once-a-day to four-times-a-day, as well as studies in primate epilepsy models involving constant rate infusion, indicate that total daily systemic bioavailability (extent of absorption) is the primary determinant of seizure control and that differences in the ratios of plasma peak to trough concentrations between valproate formulations are inconsequential from a practical clinical standpoint. Whether or not rate of absorption influences the efficacy of valproate as an antimanic or antimigraine agent is unknown. Co-administration of oral valproate products with food and substitution among the various Depakote and valproic acid formulations should cause no clinical problems in the management of patients with epilepsy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . Nonetheless, any changes in dosage administration, or the addition or discontinuance of concomitant drugs should ordinarily be accompanied by close monitoring of clinical status and valproate plasma concentrations. Distribution Protein Binding The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin). Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) for more detailed information on the pharmacokinetic interactions of valproate with other drugs ] . CNS Distribution Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10% of total concentration). Metabolism Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver. In adult patients on monotherapy, 30-50% of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. Mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40% of the dose. Usually, less than 15-20% of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine. The relationship between dose and total valproate concentration is nonlinear; concentration does not increase proportionally with the dose, but rather, increases to a lesser extent due to saturable plasma protein binding. The kinetics of unbound drug are linear. Elimination Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for total valproate are 0.56 L/hr/1.73 m 2 and 11 L/1.73 m 2 , respectively. Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free valproate are 4.6 L/hr/1.73 m 2 and 92 L/1.73 m 2 . Mean terminal half-life for valproate monotherapy ranged from 9 to 16 hours following oral dosing regimens of 250 to 1,000 mg. The estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems. For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn. Specific Populations Effect of Age Neonates Children within the first two months of life have a markedly decreased ability to eliminate valproate compared to older children and adults. This is a result of reduced clearance (perhaps due to delay in development of glucuronosyltransferase and other enzyme systems involved in valproate elimination) as well as increased volume of distribution (in part due to decreased plasma protein binding). For example, in one study, the half-life in children under 10 days ranged from 10 to 67 hours compared to a range of 7 to 13 hours in children greater than 2 months. Children Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mL/min/kg) than do adults. Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults. Elderly The capacity of elderly patients (age range: 68 to 89 years) to eliminate valproate has been shown to be reduced compared to younger adults (age range: 22 to 26 years). Intrinsic clearance is reduced by 39%; the free fraction is increased by 44%. Accordingly, the initial dosage should be reduced in the elderly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ] . Effect of Sex There are no differences in the body surface area adjusted unbound clearance between males and females (4.8\u00b10.17 and 4.7\u00b10.07 L/hr per 1.73 m 2 , respectively). Effect of Race The effects of race on the kinetics of valproate have not been studied. Effect of Disease Liver Disease Liver disease impairs the capacity to eliminate valproate. In one study, the clearance of free valproate was decreased by 50% in 7 patients with cirrhosis and by 16% in 4 patients with acute hepatitis, compared with 6 healthy subjects. In that study, the half-life of valproate was increased from 12 to 18 hours. Liver disease is also associated with decreased albumin concentrations and larger unbound fractions (2 to 2.6 fold increase) of valproate. Accordingly, monitoring of total concentrations may be misleading since free concentrations may be substantially elevated in patients with hepatic disease whereas total concentrations may appear to be normal [see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . Renal Disease A slight reduction (27%) in the unbound clearance of valproate has been reported in patients with renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/minute); however, hemodialysis typically reduces valproate concentrations by about 20%. Therefore, no dosage adjustment appears to be necessary in patients with renal failure. Protein binding in these patients is substantially reduced; thus, monitoring total concentrations may be misleading. Drug Interaction Studies with No Interaction or Likely Clinically Unimportant Interaction Antacids A study involving the co-administration of valproate 500 mg with commonly administered antacids (Maalox, Trisogel, and Titralac - 160 mEq doses) did not reveal any effect on the extent of absorption of valproate. Chlorpromazine A study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mg/day of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed a 15% increase in trough plasma levels of valproate. Haloperidol A study involving the administration of 6 to 10 mg/day of haloperidol to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed no significant changes in valproate trough plasma levels. Cimetidine and Ranitidine Cimetidine and ranitidine do not affect the clearance of valproate. Acetaminophen Valproate had no effect on any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of acetaminophen when it was concurrently administered to three epileptic patients. Clozapine In psychotic patients (n=11), no interaction was observed when valproate was co-administered with clozapine. Lithium Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lithium carbonate (300 mg TID) to normal male volunteers (n=16) had no effect on the steady-state kinetics of lithium. Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n=9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam. Olanzapine No dose adjustment for olanzapine is necessary when olanzapine is administered concomitantly with valproate. Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in C max and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine. Oral Contraceptive Steroids Administration of a single-dose of ethinyloestradiol (50 mcg)/levonorgestrel (250 mcg) to 6 women on valproate (200 mg BID) therapy for 2 months did not reveal any pharmacokinetic interaction."], "mechanism_of_action": ["12.1 Mechanism of Action Divalproex sodium dissociates to the valproate ion in the gastrointestinal tract.

While the absorption rate from the G.I. tract and fluctuation in valproate plasma concentrations vary with dosing regimen and formulation, the efficacy of valproate as an anticonvulsant in chronic use is unlikely to be affected. Experience employing dosing regimens from once-a-day to four-times-a-day, as well as studies in primate epilepsy models involving constant rate infusion, indicate that total daily systemic bioavailability (extent of absorption) is the primary determinant of seizure control and that differences in the ratios of plasma peak to trough concentrations between valproate formulations are inconsequential from a practical clinical standpoint. Whether or not rate of absorption influences the efficacy of valproate as an antimanic or antimigraine agent is unknown. Co-administration of oral valproate products with food and substitution among the various Depakote and valproic acid formulations should cause no clinical problems in the management of patients with epilepsy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . Nonetheless, any changes in dosage administration, or the addition or discontinuance of concomitant drugs should ordinarily be accompanied by close monitoring of clinical status and valproate plasma concentrations. Distribution Protein Binding The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin). Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) for more detailed information on the pharmacokinetic interactions of valproate with other drugs ] . CNS Distribution Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10% of total concentration). Metabolism Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver. In adult patients on monotherapy, 30-50% of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. Mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40% of the dose. Usually, less than 15-20% of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine. The relationship between dose and total valproate concentration is nonlinear; concentration does not increase proportionally with the dose, but rather, increases to a lesser extent due to saturable plasma protein binding. The kinetics of unbound drug are linear. Elimination Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for total valproate are 0.56 L/hr/1.73 m 2 and 11 L/1.73 m 2 , respectively. Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free valproate are 4.6 L/hr/1.73 m 2 and 92 L/1.73 m 2 . Mean terminal half-life for valproate monotherapy ranged from 9 to 16 hours following oral dosing regimens of 250 to 1,000 mg. The estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems. For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn. Specific Populations Effect of Age Neonates Children within the first two months of life have a markedly decreased ability to eliminate valproate compared to older children and adults. This is a result of reduced clearance (perhaps due to delay in development of glucuronosyltransferase and other enzyme systems involved in valproate elimination) as well as increased volume of distribution (in part due to decreased plasma protein binding). For example, in one study, the half-life in children under 10 days ranged from 10 to 67 hours compared to a range of 7 to 13 hours in children greater than 2 months. Children Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mL/min/kg) than do adults. Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults. Elderly The capacity of elderly patients (age range: 68 to 89 years) to eliminate valproate has been shown to be reduced compared to younger adults (age range: 22 to 26 years). Intrinsic clearance is reduced by 39%; the free fraction is increased by 44%. Accordingly, the initial dosage should be reduced in the elderly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ] . Effect of Sex There are no differences in the body surface area adjusted unbound clearance between males and females (4.8\u00b10.17 and 4.7\u00b10.07 L/hr per 1.73 m 2 , respectively). Effect of Race The effects of race on the kinetics of valproate have not been studied. Effect of Disease Liver Disease Liver disease impairs the capacity to eliminate valproate. In one study, the clearance of free valproate was decreased by 50% in 7 patients with cirrhosis and by 16% in 4 patients with acute hepatitis, compared with 6 healthy subjects. In that study, the half-life of valproate was increased from 12 to 18 hours. Liver disease is also associated with decreased albumin concentrations and larger unbound fractions (2 to 2.6 fold increase) of valproate. Accordingly, monitoring of total concentrations may be misleading since free concentrations may be substantially elevated in patients with hepatic disease whereas total concentrations may appear to be normal [see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . Renal Disease A slight reduction (27%) in the unbound clearance of valproate has been reported in patients with renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/minute); however, hemodialysis typically reduces valproate concentrations by about 20%. Therefore, no dosage adjustment appears to be necessary in patients with renal failure. Protein binding in these patients is substantially reduced; thus, monitoring total concentrations may be misleading. Drug Interaction Studies with No Interaction or Likely Clinically Unimportant Interaction Antacids A study involving the co-administration of valproate 500 mg with commonly administered antacids (Maalox, Trisogel, and Titralac - 160 mEq doses) did not reveal any effect on the extent of absorption of valproate. Chlorpromazine A study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mg/day of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed a 15% increase in trough plasma levels of valproate. Haloperidol A study involving the administration of 6 to 10 mg/day of haloperidol to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed no significant changes in valproate trough plasma levels. Cimetidine and Ranitidine Cimetidine and ranitidine do not affect the clearance of valproate. Acetaminophen Valproate had no effect on any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of acetaminophen when it was concurrently administered to three epileptic patients. Clozapine In psychotic patients (n=11), no interaction was observed when valproate was co-administered with clozapine. Lithium Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lithium carbonate (300 mg TID) to normal male volunteers (n=16) had no effect on the steady-state kinetics of lithium. Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n=9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam. Olanzapine No dose adjustment for olanzapine is necessary when olanzapine is administered concomitantly with valproate. Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in C max and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine. Oral Contraceptive Steroids Administration of a single-dose of ethinyloestradiol (50 mcg)/levonorgestrel (250 mcg) to 6 women on valproate (200 mg BID) therapy for 2 months did not reveal any pharmacokinetic interaction."], "nonclinical_toxicology": ["13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Valproate was administered orally to rats and mice at doses of 80 and 170 mg/kg/day (less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) for two years.

(1) Study 1: The first study enrolled adult patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for bipolar disorder and who were hospitalized for acute mania. In addition, they had a history of failing to respond to or not tolerating previous lithium carbonate treatment. Depakote was initiated at a dose of 250 mg tid and adjusted to achieve serum valproate concentrations in a range of 50-100 mcg/mL by day 7. Mean Depakote doses for completers in this study were 1,118, 1,525, and 2,402 mg/day at Days 7, 14, and 21, respectively. Patients were assessed on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; score ranges from 0-60), an augmented Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-A), and the Global Assessment Scale (GAS). Baseline scores and change from baseline in the Week 3 endpoint (last-observation-carry-forward) analysis were as follows: Table 6.

(2) Study 2: The second study enrolled adult patients who met Research Diagnostic Criteria for manic disorder and who were hospitalized for acute mania. Depakote was initiated at a dose of 250 mg tid and adjusted within a dose range of 750-2,500 mg/day to achieve serum valproate concentrations in a range of 40-150 mcg/mL. Mean Depakote doses for completers in this study were 1,116, 1,683, and 2,006 mg/day at Days 7, 14, and 21, respectively. Study 2 also included a lithium group for which lithium doses for completers were 1,312, 1,869, and 1,984 mg/day at Days 7, 14, and 21, respectively. Patients were assessed on the Manic Rating Scale (MRS; score ranges from 11-63), and the primary outcome measures were the total MRS score, and scores for two subscales of the MRS, i.e., the Manic Syndrome Scale (MSS) and the Behavior and Ideation Scale (BIS). Baseline scores and change from baseline in the Week 3 endpoint (last-observation-carry-forward) analysis were as follows: Table 7.

An exploratory analysis for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or gender. A comparison of the percentage of patients showing \u2265 30% reduction in the symptom score from baseline in each treatment group, separated by study, is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 * p < 0.05 PBO = placebo, DVPX = Depakote Figure 1 14.2 Epilepsy The efficacy of valproate in reducing the incidence of complex partial seizures (CPS) that occur in isolation or in association with other seizure types was established in two controlled trials. In one, multi-clinic, placebo controlled study employing an add-on design (adjunctive therapy), 144 patients who continued to suffer eight or more CPS per 8 weeks during an 8 week period of monotherapy with doses of either carbamazepine or phenytoin sufficient to assure plasma concentrations within the \"therapeutic range\" were randomized to receive, in addition to their original antiepilepsy drug (AED), either Depakote or placebo. Randomized patients were to be followed for a total of 16 weeks. The following table presents the findings. Table 8. Adjunctive Therapy Study Median Incidence of CPS per 8 Weeks Add-on Treatment Number of Patients Baseline Incidence Experimental Incidence Depakote 75 16.0 8.9* Placebo 69 14.5 11.5 * Reduction from baseline statistically significantly greater for valproate than placebo at p \u2264 0.05 level. Figure 2 presents the proportion of patients (X axis) whose percentage reduction from baseline in complex partial seizure rates was at least as great as that indicated on the Y axis in the adjunctive therapy study. A positive percent reduction indicates an improvement (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative percent reduction indicates worsening. Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. This figure shows that the proportion of patients achieving any particular level of improvement was consistently higher for valproate than for placebo. For example, 45% of patients treated with valproate had a \u2265 50% reduction in complex partial seizure rate compared to 23% of patients treated with placebo. Figure 2 The second study assessed the capacity of valproate to reduce the incidence of CPS when administered as the sole AED. The study compared the incidence of CPS among patients randomized to either a high or low dose treatment arm. Patients qualified for entry into the randomized comparison phase of this study only if 1) they continued to experience 2 or more CPS per 4 weeks during an 8 to 12 week long period of monotherapy with adequate doses of an AED (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or primidone) and 2) they made a successful transition over a two week interval to valproate. Patients entering the randomized phase were then brought to their assigned target dose, gradually tapered off their concomitant AED and followed for an interval as long as 22 weeks. Less than 50% of the patients randomized, however, completed the study. In patients converted to Depakote monotherapy, the mean total valproate concentrations during monotherapy were 71 and 123 mcg/mL in the low dose and high dose groups, respectively. The following table presents the findings for all patients randomized who had at least one post-randomization assessment. Table 9. Monotherapy Study Median Incidence of CPS per 8 Weeks Treatment Number of Patients Baseline Incidence Randomized Phase Incidence High dose Depakote 131 13.2 10.7* Low dose Depakote 134 14.2 13.8 * Reduction from baseline statistically significantly greater for high dose than low dose at p \u2264 0.05 level. Figure 3 presents the proportion of patients (X axis) whose percentage reduction from baseline in complex partial seizure rates was at least as great as that indicated on the Y axis in the monotherapy study. A positive percent reduction indicates an improvement (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative percent reduction indicates worsening. Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for a more effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for a less effective treatment. This figure shows that the proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction was consistently higher for high dose valproate than for low dose valproate. For example, when switching from carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital or primidone monotherapy to high dose valproate monotherapy, 63% of patients experienced no change or a reduction in complex partial seizure rates compared to 54% of patients receiving low dose valproate. Figure 3 Information on pediatric studies is presented in section 8. Figure 2 Figure 3 14.3 Migraine The results of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials established the effectiveness of Depakote in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache. Both studies employed essentially identical designs and recruited patients with a history of migraine with or without aura (of at least 6 months in duration) who were experiencing at least 2 migraine headaches a month during the 3 months prior to enrollment. Patients with cluster headaches were excluded. Women of childbearing potential were excluded entirely from one study, but were permitted in the other if they were deemed to be practicing an effective method of contraception. In each study following a 4-week single-blind placebo baseline period, patients were randomized, under double blind conditions, to Depakote or placebo for a 12-week treatment phase, comprised of a 4-week dose titration period followed by an 8-week maintenance period. Treatment outcome was assessed on the basis of 4-week migraine headache rates during the treatment phase. In the first study, a total of 107 patients (24 M, 83 F), ranging in age from 26 to 73 were randomized 2:1, Depakote to placebo. Ninety patients completed the 8-week maintenance period. Drug dose titration, using 250 mg tablets, was individualized at the investigator's discretion. Adjustments were guided by actual/sham trough total serum valproate levels in order to maintain the study blind. In patients on Depakote doses ranged from 500 to 2,500 mg a day. Doses over 500 mg were given in three divided doses (TID). The mean dose during the treatment phase was 1,087 mg/day resulting in a mean trough total valproate level of 72.5 mcg/mL, with a range of 31 to 133 mcg/mL. The mean 4-week migraine headache rate during the treatment phase was 5.7 in the placebo group compared to 3.5 in the Depakote group (see Figure 4). These rates were significantly different. In the second study, a total of 176 patients (19 males and 157 females), ranging in age from 17 to 76 years, were randomized equally to one of three Depakote dose groups (500, 1,000, or 1,500 mg/day) or placebo. The treatments were given in two divided doses (BID). One hundred thirty-seven patients completed the 8-week maintenance period. Efficacy was to be determined by a comparison of the 4-week migraine headache rate in the combined 1,000/1,500 mg/day group and placebo group. The initial dose was 250 mg daily. The regimen was advanced by 250 mg every 4 days (8 days for 500 mg/day group), until the randomized dose was achieved. The mean trough total valproate levels during the treatment phase were 39.6, 62.5, and 72.5 mcg/mL in the Depakote 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mg/day groups, respectively. The mean 4-week migraine headache rates during the treatment phase, adjusted for differences in baseline rates, were 4.5 in the placebo group, compared to 3.3, 3.0, and 3.3 in the Depakote 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mg/day groups, respectively, based on intent-to-treat results (see Figure 4). Migraine headache rates in the combined Depakote 1,000/1,500 mg group were significantly lower than in the placebo group.

Do not stop Depakote without first talking to a healthcare provider . Stopping Depakote suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly in a patient who has epilepsy can cause seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). Depakote can cause serious side effects, including: 1.

The risk of getting this serious liver damage is more likely to happen within the first 6 months of treatment. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms: feeling very weak, tired, or uncomfortable (malaise) swelling of your face not feeling hungry nausea or vomiting that does not go away diarrhea pain on the right side of your stomach (abdomen) dark urine yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes loss of seizure control in people with epilepsy In some cases, liver damage may continue even though the medicine is stopped.

If you take Depakote during pregnancy for any medical condition, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects that affect the brain and spinal cord (such as spina bifida or neural tube defects). These defects can begin in the first month, even before you know you are pregnant. Other birth defects that affect the structures of the heart, head, arms, legs, and the opening where the urine comes out (urethra) on the bottom of the penis can also happen. Decreased hearing or hearing loss can also happen. Birth defects may occur even in children born to women who are not taking any medicines and do not have other risk factors. Taking folic acid supplements before getting pregnant and during early pregnancy can lower the chance of having a baby with a neural tube defect.

Women should be advised not to become pregnant when taking FARESTON. ( 5.7 , 8.1 ) Women of Childbearing Potential: Use effective nonhormonal contraception during FARESTON therapy. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Prolongation of the QT Interval Toremifene has been shown to prolong the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-related manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Prolongation of the QT interval can result in a type of ventricular tachycardia called Torsade de pointes, which may result in syncope, seizure, and/or death. Toremifene should be avoided in patients with long QT syndrome. Caution should be exercised in patients with congestive heart failure, hepatic impairment and electrolyte abnormalities. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to initiating toremifene and these electrolytes should be monitored periodically during therapy. Drugs that prolong the QT interval should be avoided. In patients at increased risk, electrocardiograms (ECGs) should be obtained at baseline and as clinically indicated [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity, both increases in the serum concentration for grade 3 and 4 transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia, including jaundice, hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, have also been reported in clinical trials and postmarketing with FARESTON. Liver function tests should be performed periodically. [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Post-marketing Experience (6.2) ] 5.3 Hypercalcemia and Tumor Flare As with other antiestrogens, hypercalcemia and tumor flare have been reported in some breast cancer patients with bone metastases during the first weeks of treatment with FARESTON. Tumor flare is a syndrome of diffuse musculoskeletal pain and erythema with increased size of tumor lesions that later regress. It is often accompanied by hypercalcemia. Tumor flare does not imply failure of treatment or represent tumor progression. If hypercalcemia occurs, appropriate measures should be instituted and, if hypercalcemia is severe, FARESTON treatment should be discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Uterine Malignancy Endometrial cancer, endometrial hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and uterine polyps have been reported in some patients treated with FARESTON. Endometrial hyperplasia of the uterus was observed in animals treated with toremifene [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Long-term use of FARESTON has not been established in patients with pre-existing endometrial hyperplasia. All patients should have baseline and annual gynecological examinations. In particular, patients at high risk of endometrial cancer should be closely monitored. 5.5 General Patients with a history of thromboembolic diseases should generally not be treated with FARESTON. Patients with bone metastases should be monitored closely for hypercalcemia during the first weeks of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have been reported rarely; leukocyte and platelet counts should be monitored when using FARESTON in patients with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. 5.6 Laboratory Tests Periodic complete blood counts, calcium levels, and liver function tests should be obtained. 5.7 Use in Pregnancy Based on its mechanism of action in humans and findings of increased pregnancy loss and fetal malformation in animal studies, FARESTON can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Toremifene caused embryo-fetal toxicities at maternal doses that were lower than the 60 mg daily recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using FARESTON. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.8 Women of Childbearing Potential FARESTON is indicated only in postmenopausal women. However, premenopausal women prescribed FARESTON should use effective non-hormonal contraception and should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus should pregnancy occur."], "adverse_reactions": ["6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Most common adverse reactions are hot flashes, sweating, nausea and vaginal discharge.

The incidences of the following eight clinical toxicities were prospectively assessed in the North American Study. The incidence reflects the toxicities that were considered by the investigator to be drug related or possibly drug related. North American Study FAR60 TAM20 n = 221 n = 215 Hot Flashes 35% 30% Sweating 20% 17% Nausea 14% 15% Vaginal Discharge 13% 16% Dizziness 9% 7% Edema 5% 5% Vomiting 4% 2% Vaginal Bleeding 2% 4% Approximately 1% of patients receiving FARESTON (n = 592) in the three controlled studies discontinued treatment as a result of adverse reactions (nausea and vomiting, fatigue, thrombophlebitis, depression, lethargy, anorexia, ischemic attack, arthritis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction). Serious adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of patients receiving FARESTON in the three major trials are listed in the table below. Three prospective, randomized, controlled clinical studies (North American, Eastern European, and Nordic) were conducted. The patients were randomized to parallel groups receiving FARESTON 60 mg (FAR60) or tamoxifen 20 mg (TAM20) in the North American Study or tamoxifen 40 mg (TAM40) in the Eastern European and Nordic studies. The North American and Eastern European studies also included high-dose toremifene arms of 200 and 240 mg daily, respectively [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . * Most of the ocular abnormalities were observed in the North American Study in which on-study and biannual ophthalmic examinations were performed. No cases of retinopathy were observed in any arm. ** Elevated defined as follows: North American Study: AST >100 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase >200 IU/L; bilirubin > 2 mg/dL.

The incidence of AST elevations was greater in the 200 and 240 mg FARESTON dose arms than in the tamoxifen arms. Higher doses of FARESTON were also associated with an increase in nausea. Approximately 4% of patients were withdrawn for toxicity from the high-dose FARESTON treatment arms. Reasons for withdrawal included hypercalcemia, abnormal liver function tests, and one case each of toxic hepatitis, depression, dizziness, incoordination, ataxia, blurry vision, diffuse dermatitis, and a constellation of symptoms consisting of nausea, sweating, and tremor. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of FARESTON. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported during post approval use of FARESTON have been consistent with clinical trial experience. The most frequently reported adverse reactions related to FARESTON use since market introduction include hot flash, sweating, nausea, and vaginal discharge.

receiving FARESTON. ( 7.1 ) Agents that prolong QT should be avoided. ( 7.2 ) Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may result in a relevant decrease in FARESTON exposure and should be avoided. ( 7.3 ) Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor can result in a relevant increase in FARESTON exposure and should be avoided. ( 7.4 ) CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin or phenytoin with FARESTON should be used with caution and require careful monitoring. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Drugs that Decrease Renal Calcium Excretion Drugs that decrease renal calcium excretion, e.g., thiazide diuretics, may increase the risk of hypercalcemia in patients receiving FARESTON. 7.2 Agents that Prolong QT The administration of FARESTON with agents that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects should be avoided. Should treatment with any of these agents be required, it is recommended that therapy with FARESTON be interrupted. If interruption of treatment with FARESTON is not possible, patients who require treatment with a drug that prolongs QT should be closely monitored for prolongation of the QT interval. Agents generally accepted to prolong QT interval include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide) antiarrhythmics; certain antipsychotics (e.g., thioridazine, haloperidol); certain antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine, amitriptyline); certain antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin); and certain anti-emetics (e.g., ondansetron, granisetron). In patients at increased risk, electrocardiograms (ECGs) should be obtained and patients monitored as clinically indicated [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 7.3 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Toremifene Strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers, such as dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort, lower the steady-state concentration of toremifene in serum. 7.4 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Toremifene In a study of 18 healthy subjects, 80 mg toremifene once daily coadministered with 200 mg of ketoconazole twice daily increased the toremifene Cmax and AUC by 1.4- and 2.9-fold, respectively. N-demethyltoremifene Cmax and AUC were reduced by 56% and 20%, respectively. The administration of FARESTON with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole) increase the steady-state concentration in serum and should be avoided. Grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of toremifene and should be avoided. Should treatment with any of these agents be required, it is recommended that therapy with FARESTON be interrupted. If interruption of treatment with FARESTON is not possible, patients who require treatment with a drug that strongly inhibits CYP3A4 should be closely monitored for prolongation of the QT interval [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 7.5 Effect of Toremifene on CYP3A4 Substrates In a study of 20 healthy subjects, 2 mg midazolam once daily (days 6 and 18) coadministered with toremifene as a 480 mg loading dose followed by 80 mg once daily for 16 days. Following coadministration on days 6 and 18 relevant increases in midazolam and \u03b1-hydroxymidazolam Cmax and AUC were not observed. Following coadministration on day 18 midazolam and \u03b1-hydroxymidazolam Cmax and AUC were reduced by less than 20%. Clinically relevant exposure changes in sensitive substrates due to inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 by toremifene appear unlikely. 7.6 Effect of Toremifene on CYP2C9 Substrates In a study of 20 healthy subjects, 500 mg tolbutamide once daily (days 7 and 19) coadministered with toremifene as a 480 mg loading dose followed by 80 mg once daily for 16 days. Following coadministration on days 7 and 19 plasma tolbutamide Cmax and AUC were increased by less than 30%. A reduction of similar magnitude was observed for hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide Cmax and AUC. Toremifene is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9. Concomitant use of CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin or phenytoin with FARESTON should be done with caution and requires careful monitoring (e.g., substrate concentrations (if possible), appropriate laboratory markers, and signs and symptoms of increased exposure)."], "use_in_specific_populations": ["8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing Mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) .] Based on its mechanism of action in humans and findings of increased pregnancy loss and fetal malformation in animal studies, FARESTON can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Toremifene caused embryo-fetal toxicities at maternal doses that were lower than the 60 mg daily recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using FARESTON. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. In animal studies, toremifene crossed the placenta and accumulated in the rodent fetus. Administration of toremifene to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of approximately 6% the daily maximum recommended human dose of 60 mg (on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in signs of maternal toxicity and increased preimplantation loss, increased resorptions, reduced fetal weight, and fetal anomalies. Fetal anomalies include malformation of limbs, incomplete ossification, misshapen bones, ribs/spine anomalies, hydroureter, hydronephrosis, testicular displacement, and subcutaneous edema. Maternal toxicity may have contributed to these adverse embryo-fetal effects. Similar embryo-fetal toxicities occurred in rabbits that received toremifene at doses approximately 40% the daily recommended human dose of 60 mg (on a mg/m 2 basis). Findings in rabbits included increased preimplantation loss, increased resorptions, and fetal anomalies, including incomplete ossification and anencephaly. Animal doses resulting in embryo-fetal toxicities were \u22651.0 mg/kg/day in rats and \u22651.25 mg/kg/day in rabbits. In rodent models of fetal reproductive tract development, toremifene produced inhibition of uterine development in female pups similar to effects seen with diethylstilbestrol (DES) and tamoxifen. The clinical relevance of these changes is not known. Neonatal rodent studies have not been conducted to assess the potential for toremifene to cause other DES-like effects in offspring (i.e., vaginal adenosis). Vaginal adenosis in animals occurred following treatment with other drugs of this class and has been observed in women exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero. 8.2 Nursing Mothers It is not known if toremifene is excreted in human milk. Toremifene is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from FARESTON, a decision should be made to either discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.3 Pediatric Use There is no indication for use of FARESTON in pediatric patients. 8.4 Geriatric Use The pharmacokinetics of toremifene were studied in 10 healthy young males and 10 elderly females following a single 120 mg dose under fasting conditions. Increases in the elimination half-life (4.2 versus 7.2 days) and the volume of distribution (457 versus 627 L) of toremifene were seen in the elderly females without any change in clearance or AUC. The median ages in the three controlled studies ranged from 60 to 66 years. No significant age-related differences in FARESTON effectiveness or safety were noted. 8.5 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of toremifene and N-demethyltoremifene were similar in normals and in patients with impaired kidney function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The mean elimination half-life of toremifene was increased by less than twofold in 10 patients with hepatic impairment (cirrhosis or fibrosis) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The pharmacokinetics of N-demethyltoremifene were unchanged in these patients. Ten patients on anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, clonazepam, phenytoin, and carbamazepine) showed a twofold increase in clearance and a decrease in the elimination half-life of toremifene. 8.7 Race The pharmacokinetics of toremifene in patients of different races has not been studied.

Toremifene binds to estrogen receptors and may exert estrogenic, antiestrogenic, or both activities, depending upon the duration of treatment, animal species, gender, target organ, or endpoint selected. In general, however, nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivatives are predominantly antiestrogenic in rats and humans and estrogenic in mice. In rats, toremifene causes regression of established dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors. The antitumor effect of toremifene in breast cancer is believed to be mainly due to its antiestrogenic effects, i.e., its ability to compete with estrogen for binding sites in the cancer, blocking the growth-stimulating effects of estrogen in the tumor. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Toremifene causes a decrease in the estradiol-induced vaginal cornification index in some postmenopausal women, indicative of its antiestrogenic activity. Toremifene also has estrogenic activity as shown by decreases in serum gonadotropin concentrations (FSH and LH). Effects on Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 20 mg, 80 mg, and 300 mg of toremifene on QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized study in healthy male subjects aged 18 to 45 years. The QT interval was measured at steady state of toremifene (Day 5 of dosing), including the time of peak plasma concentration (Tmax), at 13 time points (4 ECGs/time point) over 24 hours post dose in a time matched analysis. The 300 mg dose of toremifene (approximately five times the highest recommended dose 60 mg) was chosen because this dose produces exposure to toremifene that will cover the expected exposures that may result from potential drug interactions and hepatic impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Dose and concentration-related increases in the QTc interval and T wave changes were observed (see Table 1 ). These effects are believed to be caused by toremifene and N-demethyltoremifene. Toremifene had no effects on heart rate, PR and QRS interval duration [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Table 1: QTc Prolongation in Healthy Male Volunteers Treatment Arm Mean (90% CI) \u0394\u0394QTc, ms \u0394QTc > 60 ms (n, %) QTc > 500 ms (n, %) Toremifene 20 mg (N = 47) 7 (0.9, 13.6) 0 0 Toremifene 80 mg (N = 47) 26 (21.1, 31.2) 2 (4.3%) 0 Toremifene 300 mg (N = 48) 65 (60.1, 69.2) 43 (89.6%) 5 (10.4%) 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption - Toremifene is well absorbed after oral administration and absorption is not influenced by food. Peak plasma concentrations are obtained within 3 hours. Toremifene displays linear pharmacokinetics after single oral doses of 10 to 680 mg. After multiple dosing, dose proportionality was observed for doses of 10 to 400 mg. Steady state concentrations were reached in about 4-6 weeks. Distribution - Toremifene has an apparent volume of distribution of 580 L and binds extensively (>99.5%) to serum proteins, mainly albumin. Metabolism - Toremifene is extensively metabolized, principally by CYP3A4 to N-demethyltoremifene which is also antiestrogenic but with weak in vivo antitumor potency. Serum concentrations of N-demethyltoremifene are 2 to 4 times higher than toremifene at steady state. Following multiple dosing with toremifene in 20 healthy volunteers, plasma toremifene exposure was lower on Day 17 compared to Day 5 by approximately 14%. N-demethyltoremifene exposure was higher on Day 17 compared to Day 5 by approximately 80%. Based on these data and an in vitro induction study in human hepatocytes, auto-induction of CYP3A4 by toremifene is likely. The effect of auto-induction on efficacy was likely captured following prolonged dosing in the clinical studies. Elimination - The plasma concentration time profile of toremifene declines biexponentially after absorption with a mean distribution half-life of about 4 hours and an elimination half-life of about 5 days. Elimination half-lives of major metabolites, N-demethyltoremifene and (Deaminohydroxy) toremifene, were 6 and 4 days, respectively. Mean total clearance of toremifene was approximately 5 L/h. Toremifene is eliminated as metabolites primarily in the feces, with about 10% excreted in the urine during a 1-week period. Elimination of toremifene is slow, in part because of enterohepatic circulation. Renal insufficiency - The pharmacokinetics of toremifene and N-demethyltoremifene were similar in normals and patients with impaired kidney function. Hepatic insufficiency - The mean elimination half-life of toremifene was increased by less than twofold in 10 patients with hepatic impairment (cirrhosis or fibrosis) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The pharmacokinetics of N-demethyltoremifene were unchanged in these patients. Ten patients on anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, clonazepam, phenytoin, and carbamazepine) showed a twofold increase in clearance and a decrease in the elimination half-life of toremifene. Geriatric patients - The pharmacokinetics of toremifene were studied in 10 healthy young males and 10 elderly females following a single 120 mg dose under fasting conditions. Increases in the elimination half-life (4.2 versus 7.2 days) and the volume of distribution (457 versus 627 L) of toremifene were seen in the elderly females without any change in clearance or AUC. The median ages in the three controlled studies ranged from 60 to 66 years. No significant age-related differences in FARESTON effectiveness or safety were noted. Food - The rate and extent of absorption of FARESTON are not influenced by food; thus FARESTON may be taken with or without food.

Serum concentrations of N-demethyltoremifene are 2 to 4 times higher than toremifene at steady state. Following multiple dosing with toremifene in 20 healthy volunteers, plasma toremifene exposure was lower on Day 17 compared to Day 5 by approximately 14%. N-demethyltoremifene exposure was higher on Day 17 compared to Day 5 by approximately 80%. Based on these data and an in vitro induction study in human hepatocytes, auto-induction of CYP3A4 by toremifene is likely. The effect of auto-induction on efficacy was likely captured following prolonged dosing in the clinical studies. Elimination - The plasma concentration time profile of toremifene declines biexponentially after absorption with a mean distribution half-life of about 4 hours and an elimination half-life of about 5 days. Elimination half-lives of major metabolites, N-demethyltoremifene and (Deaminohydroxy) toremifene, were 6 and 4 days, respectively. Mean total clearance of toremifene was approximately 5 L/h. Toremifene is eliminated as metabolites primarily in the feces, with about 10% excreted in the urine during a 1-week period. Elimination of toremifene is slow, in part because of enterohepatic circulation. Renal insufficiency - The pharmacokinetics of toremifene and N-demethyltoremifene were similar in normals and patients with impaired kidney function. Hepatic insufficiency - The mean elimination half-life of toremifene was increased by less than twofold in 10 patients with hepatic impairment (cirrhosis or fibrosis) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The pharmacokinetics of N-demethyltoremifene were unchanged in these patients. Ten patients on anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, clonazepam, phenytoin, and carbamazepine) showed a twofold increase in clearance and a decrease in the elimination half-life of toremifene. Geriatric patients - The pharmacokinetics of toremifene were studied in 10 healthy young males and 10 elderly females following a single 120 mg dose under fasting conditions. Increases in the elimination half-life (4.2 versus 7.2 days) and the volume of distribution (457 versus 627 L) of toremifene were seen in the elderly females without any change in clearance or AUC. The median ages in the three controlled studies ranged from 60 to 66 years. No significant age-related differences in FARESTON effectiveness or safety were noted. Food - The rate and extent of absorption of FARESTON are not influenced by food; thus FARESTON may be taken with or without food. Race - The pharmacokinetics of toremifene in patients of different races has not been studied. Fourteen percent of patients in the North American Study were non-Caucasian. No significant race-related differences in FARESTON effectiveness or safety were noted."], "nonclinical_toxicology": ["13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Conventional carcinogenesis studies in rats at doses of 0.12 to 12 mg/kg/day (approximately 1/50 to 2 times the daily maximum recommended human dose of 60 mg, on a mg/m 2 basis) for up to 2 years did not show evidence of carcinogenicity. Studies in mice at doses of 1.0 to 30.0 mg/kg/day (approximately 1/15 to 2 times the daily maximum recommended human dose of 60 mg, on a mg/m 2 basis) for up to 2 years revealed increased incidence of ovarian and testicular tumors and increased incidence of osteoma and osteosarcoma. The significance of the mouse findings is uncertain because of the different role of estrogens in mice and the estrogenic effect of toremifene in mice. An increased incidence of ovarian and testicular tumors in mice has also been observed with other human estrogen agonists/antagonists that have primarily estrogenic activity in mice. Endometrial hyperplasia of the uterus was observed in monkeys following 52 weeks of treatment at \u22651 mg/kg and in dogs following 16 weeks of treatment at \u22653 mg/kg with toremifene (approximately 1/3 and 1.4 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose of 60 mg, on a mg/m 2 basis).

The patients were randomized to parallel groups receiving FARESTON 60 mg (FAR60) or tamoxifen 20 mg (TAM20) in the North American Study or tamoxifen 40 mg (TAM40) in the Eastern European and Nordic studies. The North American and Eastern European studies also included high-dose toremifene arms of 200 and 240 mg daily, respectively. The studies included postmenopausal patients with estrogen-receptor (ER) positive or estrogen-receptor (ER) unknown metastatic breast cancer. The patients had at least one measurable or evaluable lesion. The primary efficacy variables were response rate (RR) and time to progression (TTP). Survival (S) was also determined. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for the difference in RR between FAR60 and TAM groups and the hazard ratio (relative risk for an unfavorable event, such as disease progression or death) between TAM and FAR60 for TTP and S.

Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF. For patients with myocarditis, with or without a decreased ejection fraction, MRI or cardiac biopsy may be required to make the diagnosis. For new onset or worsening CHF, withhold ROZLYTREK, reassess LVEF and institute appropriate medical management. Reduce dose or permanently discontinue ROZLYTREK based on severity of CHF or worsening LVEF. ( 2.4 , 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects: CNS adverse reactions including cognitive impairment, mood disorders, dizziness, and sleep disturbances can occur with ROZLYTREK. Withhold and then resume at same or reduced dose upon improvement or permanently discontinue ROZLYTREK based on severity. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Skeletal Fractures: ROZLYTREK increases the risk of fractures. Promptly evaluate patients with signs or symptoms of fractures. ( 5.3 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver tests, including ALT and AST, every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue ROZLYTREK based on severity. If withheld, resume ROZLYTREK at same or reduced dose based on severity. ( 2.4 , 5.4 ) Hyperuricemia : Assess serum uric acid levels prior to initiation and periodically during treatment with ROZLYTREK. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. Initiate treatment with urate-lowering medications as clinically indicated and withhold ROZLYTREK for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. Resume at same or reduced dose upon improvement based on severity. ( 2.4 , 5.5 ) QT Interval Prolongation : Monitor patients who have or who are at risk for QTc interval prolongation. Assess QT interval and electrolytes at baseline and periodically during treatment. Withhold and then resume at same or reduced dose, or permanently discontinue ROZLYTREK based on severity. ( 2.4 , 5.6 ) Vision Disorders : Withhold for new visual changes or changes that interfere with activities of daily living until improvement or stabilization. Conduct an ophthalmological evaluation as appropriate. Resume at same or reduced dose upon improvement or stabilization. ( 2.4 , 5.7 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.8 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Among the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, congestive heart failure (CHF) occurred in 3.4% of patients, including Grade 3 (2.3%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In clinical trials, baseline cardiac function and routine cardiac monitoring other than electrocardiograms (ECGs) were not conducted and eligibility criteria excluded patients with symptomatic CHF, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and coronary artery bypass graft within 3 months of study entry. Among the 12 patients with CHF, the median time to onset was 2 months (range: 11 days to 12 months). ROZLYTREK was interrupted in 6 of these patients (50%) and discontinued in 2 of these patients (17%). CHF resolved in 6 patients (50%) following interruption or discontinuation of ROZLYTREK and institution of appropriate medical management. In addition, myocarditis in the absence of CHF was documented in 0.3% of patients. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of ROZLYTREK in patients with symptoms or known risk factors for CHF. Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF, including shortness of breath and edema. For patients with myocarditis, with or without a decreased ejection fraction, MRI or cardiac biopsy may be required to make the diagnosis. For patients with new onset or worsening CHF, withhold ROZLYTREK, institute appropriate medical management, and reassess LVEF. Based on the severity of CHF or worsening LVEF, resume ROZLYTREK at a reduced dose upon recovery to baseline or permanently discontinue [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects A broad spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions occurred in patients receiving ROZLYTREK, including cognitive impairment, mood disorders, dizziness, and sleep disturbances. Among the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 96 (27%) experienced cognitive impairment; symptoms occurred within 3 months of starting ROZLYTREK in 74 (77%). Cognitive impairment included cognitive disorders (8%), confusional state (7%), disturbance in attention (4.8%), memory impairment (3.7%), amnesia (2.5%), aphasia (2.3%), mental status changes (2%), hallucinations (1.1%), and delirium (0.8%). Grade 3 cognitive adverse reactions occurred in 4.5% of patients. Among the 96 patients with cognitive impairment, 13% required a dose reduction, 18% required dose interruption and 1% discontinued ROZLYTREK due to cognitive adverse reactions. Among the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 36 (10%) experienced mood disorders. The median time to onset of mood disorders was 1 month (range: 1 day to 9 months). Mood disorders occurring in \u2265 1% of patients included anxiety (4.8%), depression (2.8%) and agitation (2%). Grade 3 mood disorders occurred in 0.6% of patients. One completed suicide was reported 11 days after treatment had ended. Among the 36 patients who experienced mood disorders, 6% required a dose reduction, 6% required dose interruption and no patients discontinued ROZLYTREK due to mood disorders. Dizziness occurred in 136 (38%) of the 355 patients. Among the 136 patients who experienced dizziness, Grade 3 dizziness occurred in 2.2% of patients. Ten percent of patients required a dose reduction, 7% required dose interruption and 0.7% discontinued ROZLYTREK due to dizziness. Among the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 51 (14%) experienced sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances included insomnia (7%), somnolence (7%), hypersomnia (1.1%), and sleep disorder (0.3%). Grade 3 sleep disturbances occurred in 0.6% of patients. Among the 51 patients who experienced sleep disturbances, 6% required a dose reduction and no patients discontinued ROZLYTREK due to sleep disturbances. The incidence of CNS adverse reactions was similar in patients with and without CNS metastases; however, the incidence of dizziness (38% vs 31%), headache (21% vs 13%), paresthesia (20% vs 6%), balance disorder (13% vs 4%), and confusional state (11% vs 2%) appeared to be increased in patients with CNS metastases who had received prior CNS irradiation (N = 90) compared to those who did not (N = 48). Advise patients and caregivers of these risks with ROZLYTREK. Advise patients not to drive or operate hazardous machinery if they are experiencing CNS adverse reactions. Withhold and then resume at same or reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently discontinue ROZLYTREK based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.3 Skeletal Fractures ROZLYTREK increases the risk of fractures. In an expanded safety population that included 338 adult patients and 30 pediatric patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 5% of adult patients and 23% of pediatric patients experienced fractures [see Use in Specific Population (8.4) ] . In adult patients, some fractures occurred in the setting of a fall or other trauma to the affected area, while in pediatric patients all fractures occurred in patients with minimal or no trauma. In general, there was inadequate assessment for tumor involvement at the site of fracture; however, radiologic abnormalities possibly indicative of tumor involvement were reported in some patients. In both adult and pediatric patients, most fractures were hip or other lower extremity fractures (e.g., femoral or tibial shaft). In a limited number of patients, bilateral femoral neck fractures occurred. The median time to fracture was 3.8 months (range 0.3 to 18.5 months) in adults and 4.0 months (range: 1.8 months to 7.4 months) in pediatric patients. ROZLYTREK was interrupted in 41% of adults and 43% of pediatric patients due to fractures. No patients discontinued ROZLYTREK due to fractures. Promptly evaluate patients with signs or symptoms (e.g., pain, changes in mobility, deformity) of fractures. There are no data on the effects of ROZLYTREK on healing of known fractures and risk of future fractures. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Among the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK, increased AST of any grade occurred in 42% of patients and increased ALT of any grade occurred in 36%. Grade 3 \u2013 4 increased AST or ALT occurred in 2.5% and 2.8% of patients, respectively; the incidence may be underestimated as 4.5% of patients had no post-treatment liver function tests [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The median time to onset of increased AST was 2 weeks (range: 1 day to 29.5 months). The median time to onset of increased ALT was 2 weeks (range: 1 day to 9.2 months). Increased AST or ALT leading to dose interruptions or reductions occurred in 0.8% and 0.8% of patients, respectively. ROZLYTREK was discontinued due to increased AST or ALT in 0.8% patients. Monitor liver tests, including ALT and AST, every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue ROZLYTREK based on the severity. If withheld, resume ROZLYTREK at the same or reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.5 Hyperuricemia Among 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 32 patients (9%) experienced hyperuricemia reported as adverse reactions with symptoms, as well as elevated uric acid levels. Grade 4 hyperuricemia occurred in 1.7% of patients, including one patient who died due to tumor lysis syndrome. Among the 32 patients with hyperuricemic adverse reactions, 34% required urate-lowering medication to reduce uric acid levels, 6% required dose reduction and 6% required dose interruption. Hyperuricemia resolved in 73% of patients following initiation of urate-lowering medication without interruption or dose reduction of ROZLYTREK. No patients discontinued ROZLYTREK due to hyperuricemia. Assess serum uric acid levels prior to initiating ROZLYTREK and periodically during treatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. Initiate treatment with urate-lowering medications as clinically indicated and withhold ROZLYTREK for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. Resume ROZLYTREK at same or reduced dose upon improvement of signs or symptoms based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.6 QT Interval Prolongation Among the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across the clinical trials, 3.1% of patients with at least one post-baseline ECG assessment experienced QTcF interval prolongation of > 60 ms after starting ROZLYTREK and 0.6% had a QTcF interval > 500 ms [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc interval prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Assess QT interval and electrolytes at baseline and periodically during treatment, adjusting frequency based upon risk factors such as congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or concomitant medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Based on the severity of QTc interval prolongation, withhold ROZLYTREK and then resume at same or reduced dose, or permanently discontinue [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.7 Vision Disorders Among the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, vision changes occurred in 21% of patients, including Grade 1 (17%), Grade 2 (2.8%) and Grade 3 (0.8%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Vision disorders occurring in \u2265 1% included blurred vision (9%), photophobia (5%), diplopia (3.1%), visual impairment (2%), photopsia (1.1%), cataract (1.1%), and vitreous floaters (1.1%). For patients with new visual changes or changes that interfere with activities of daily living, withhold ROZLYTREK until improvement or stabilization and conduct an ophthalmological evaluation as clinically appropriate. Upon improvement or stabilization, resume ROZLYTREK at same or reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on literature reports in humans with congenital mutations leading to changes in TRK signaling, findings from animal studies, and its mechanism of action, ROZLYTREK can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of entrectinib to pregnant rats resulted in malformations at exposures approximately 2.7 times the human exposure at the 600 mg dose based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ROZLYTREK and for 5 weeks following the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ROZLYTREK and for 3 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."], "adverse_reactions": ["6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Congestive Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Central Nervous System Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Skeletal Fractures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hyperuricemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] QT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Vision Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) were fatigue, constipation, dysgeusia, edema, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, dysesthesia, dyspnea, myalgia, cognitive impairment, increased weight, cough, vomiting, pyrexia, arthralgia, and vision disorders.

Data in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and below reflect exposure to ROZLYTREK in 355 patients, including 172 (48%) patients exposed for 6 months or longer and 84 (24%) patients exposed for 1 year or longer. ROZLYTREK was studied in one dose-finding trial in adults [ALKA (n = 57)], one dose-finding and activity-estimating trial in adults [STARTRK-1 (n = 76)], one dose-finding and activity-estimating trial in pediatric and adult patients [STARTRK-NG (n = 16)], and one single arm, activity-estimating trial in adults [STARTRK-2 (n = 206)]. The population characteristics were: median age 55 years (range: 4 to 86 years); 5% (n = 17) were less than 18 years of age; 55% were female; and 66% were White, 23% were Asian, and 5% were Black; 3% were Hispanic/Latino. The most common tumors (\u2265 5%) were lung (56%), sarcoma (8%), and colon (5%). ROS1 gene fusions were present in 42% and NTRK gene fusions were present in 20%. Most adults (75%) received ROZLYTREK 600 mg orally once daily. The doses ranged from 100 mg/m 2 to 1600 mg/m 2 once daily in adults and 250 mg/m 2 to 750 mg/m 2 once daily in pediatric patients. ROZLYTREK is not indicated for pediatric patients less than 12 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) were pneumonia (3.9%), dyspnea (3.7%), pleural effusion (3.4%), sepsis (2.5%), pulmonary embolism (2.3%), respiratory failure (2%), and pyrexia (2%). Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions occurred in 60% of patients; the most common (\u2265 2%) were lung infection (5%), increased weight (7%), dyspnea (6%), fatigue/asthenia (5%), cognitive disorders (4.5%), syncope (2.5%), pulmonary embolism (3.4%), hypoxia (3.4%), pleural effusion (3.1%), hypotension (2.8%), diarrhea (2%), and urinary tract infection (2.5%). Fatal events included dyspnea (0.6%), pneumonia (0.6%), sepsis (0.6%), completed suicide (0.3%), large intestine perforation (0.3%) and tumor lysis syndrome (0.3%). One patient developed Grade 4 myocarditis after one dose of ROZLYTREK which resolved after discontinuation of ROZLYTREK and administration of high-dose corticosteroids. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 9% of patients who received ROZLYTREK. The most frequent adverse reactions (< 1% each) that resulted in permanent discontinuation were pneumonia, cardio-respiratory arrest, dyspnea, and fatigue. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) that resulted in interruption were increased blood creatinine (4%), fatigue (3.7%), anemia (3.1%), diarrhea (2.8%), pyrexia (2.8%), dizziness (2.5%), dyspnea (2.3%), nausea (2.3%), pneumonia (2.3%), cognitive disorder (2%) and neutropenia (2%). Dose reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients who received ROZLYTREK. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in dose reductions (\u2265 1%) were dizziness (3.9%), increased blood creatinine (3.1%), fatigue (2.3%), anemia (1.7%), and increased weight (1.4%). The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) were fatigue, constipation, dysgeusia, edema, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, dysesthesia, dyspnea, myalgia, cognitive impairment, increased weight, cough, vomiting, pyrexia, arthralgia and vision disorders.

Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with ROZLYTREK. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the ROZLYTREK dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].

( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on literature reports in humans with congenital mutations leading to changes in TRK signaling, findings from animal studies, and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , ROZLYTREK can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on ROZLYTREK use in pregnant women. Administration of entrectinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations at maternal exposures approximately 2.7 times the human exposure at the 600 mg dose (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Published reports of individuals with congenital mutations in TRK pathway proteins suggest that decreases in TRK-mediated signaling are correlated with obesity, developmental delays, cognitive impairment, insensitivity to pain, and anhidrosis. Animal Data Entrectinib administration to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at a dose of 200 mg/kg [resulting in exposures up to 2.7 times the human exposure (AUC) at the 600 mg dose] resulted in maternal toxicity and fetal malformations including body closure defects (omphalocele and gastroschisis) and malformations of the vertebrae, ribs, and limbs (micromelia and adactyly), but not embryolethality. Lower fetal weights and reduced skeletal ossification occurred at doses \u2265 12.5 and 50 mg/kg [approximately 0.2 and 0.9 times the human exposure (AUC) at the 600 mg dose], respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of entrectinib or its metabolites in human milk or their effects on either the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential adverse reactions in breastfed children from ROZLYTREK, advise a lactating woman to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with ROZLYTREK and for 7 days after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ROZLYTREK [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception ROZLYTREK can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ROZLYTREK and for at least 5 weeks following the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ROZLYTREK and for 3 months following the final dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with solid tumors that have an NTRK gene fusion have been established. The effectiveness of ROZLYTREK in adolescent patients was established based on extrapolation of data from three open-label, single-arm clinical trials in adult patients with solid tumors harboring an NTRK gene fusion (ALKA, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2) and pharmacokinetic data in adolescents enrolled in STARTRK-NG. ROZLYTREK doses based on body surface area in pediatric patients 12 years and older resulted in similar systemic exposure compared to that in adults who received a ROZLYTREK dose of 600 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . There is limited clinical experience with ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients. The safety of ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older was established based on extrapolation of data in adults and data from 30 pediatric patients enrolled in STARTRK-NG. Of these 30 patients, 7% were < 2 years (n = 2), 77% were 2 to < 12 years (n = 23), 17% were 12 to < 18 years (n = 5); 57% had metastatic disease (n = 17) and 44% had locally advanced disease (n = 13); and all patients had received prior treatment for their cancer, including surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy. The most common cancers were neuroblastoma (47%), primary CNS tumors (30%), and sarcoma (10%). The median duration of exposure for all pediatric patients was 4.2 months (range: 0.2 to 22.7 months). Due to the small number of pediatric and adult patients, the single arm design of clinical studies of ROZLYTREK, and confounding factors such as differences in susceptibility to infections between pediatric and adult patients, it is not possible to determine whether the observed differences in the incidence of adverse reactions to ROZLYTREK are related to patient age or other factors. In an expanded safety database that included 338 adult patients and 30 pediatric patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, the Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities that occurred more frequently (\u2265 5%) in pediatric patients (n = 30) compared with adults (n = 338) were neutropenia (27% vs 2%), bone fractures (23% vs 5%), increased weight (20% vs 7%), thrombocytopenia (10% vs 0.3%), lymphopenia (7% vs 1%), increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (7% vs 0%), and device-related infection (7% vs 0.3%). Three pediatric patients discontinued ROZLYTREK due to an adverse reaction (Grade 4 pulmonary edema, Grade 3 dyspnea, and Grade 4 pancreatitis). The safety and effectiveness of ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age with solid tumors who have an NTRK gene fusion have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients with ROS1 -positive NSCLC have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a 13-week juvenile rat toxicology study, animals were dosed daily from post-natal day 7 to day 97 (approximately equivalent to neonate to adulthood). Entrectinib resulted in: decreased body weight gain and delayed sexual maturation at doses \u2265 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.06 times the human exposure (AUC) at the 600 mg dose), deficits in neurobehavioral assessments including functional observational battery and learning and memory (at doses \u2265 8 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.14 times the human exposure at the 600 mg dose), and decreased femur length at doses \u2265 16 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.18 times the human exposure at the 600 mg dose). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 25% were 65 years or older, and 5% were 75 years of age or older. Clinical studies of ROZLYTREK did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to < 90 mL/min calculated by Cockcroft-Gault equation). ROZLYTREK has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 \u2013 3.0 times ULN with any aspartate aminotransferase) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3.0 times ULN with any aspartate aminotransferase) on the safety of ROZLYTREK at the recommended dosage is unknown. Consider the risk-benefit profile of ROZLYTREK prior to determining whether to administer ROZLYTREK to patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Monitor for ROZLYTREK adverse reactions in patients with hepatic impairment more frequently since these patients may be at increased risk for adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."], "pregnancy": ["8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on literature reports in humans with congenital mutations leading to changes in TRK signaling, findings from animal studies, and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , ROZLYTREK can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

Of these 30 patients, 7% were < 2 years (n = 2), 77% were 2 to < 12 years (n = 23), 17% were 12 to < 18 years (n = 5); 57% had metastatic disease (n = 17) and 44% had locally advanced disease (n = 13); and all patients had received prior treatment for their cancer, including surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy. The most common cancers were neuroblastoma (47%), primary CNS tumors (30%), and sarcoma (10%). The median duration of exposure for all pediatric patients was 4.2 months (range: 0.2 to 22.7 months). Due to the small number of pediatric and adult patients, the single arm design of clinical studies of ROZLYTREK, and confounding factors such as differences in susceptibility to infections between pediatric and adult patients, it is not possible to determine whether the observed differences in the incidence of adverse reactions to ROZLYTREK are related to patient age or other factors. In an expanded safety database that included 338 adult patients and 30 pediatric patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, the Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities that occurred more frequently (\u2265 5%) in pediatric patients (n = 30) compared with adults (n = 338) were neutropenia (27% vs 2%), bone fractures (23% vs 5%), increased weight (20% vs 7%), thrombocytopenia (10% vs 0.3%), lymphopenia (7% vs 1%), increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (7% vs 0%), and device-related infection (7% vs 0.3%). Three pediatric patients discontinued ROZLYTREK due to an adverse reaction (Grade 4 pulmonary edema, Grade 3 dyspnea, and Grade 4 pancreatitis). The safety and effectiveness of ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age with solid tumors who have an NTRK gene fusion have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients with ROS1 -positive NSCLC have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a 13-week juvenile rat toxicology study, animals were dosed daily from post-natal day 7 to day 97 (approximately equivalent to neonate to adulthood). Entrectinib resulted in: decreased body weight gain and delayed sexual maturation at doses \u2265 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.06 times the human exposure (AUC) at the 600 mg dose), deficits in neurobehavioral assessments including functional observational battery and learning and memory (at doses \u2265 8 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.14 times the human exposure at the 600 mg dose), and decreased femur length at doses \u2265 16 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.18 times the human exposure at the 600 mg dose)."], "geriatric_use": ["8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 25% were 65 years or older, and 5% were 75 years of age or older.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Entrectinib is an inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases (TRK) TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC (encoded by the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase [ NTRK ] genes NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 , respectively), proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS1 (ROS1), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with IC 50 values of 0.1 to 2 nM. Entrectinib also inhibits JAK2 and TNK2 with IC 50 values > 5 nM. The major active metabolite of entrectinib, M5, showed similar in vitro activity against TRK, ROS1, and ALK. Fusion proteins that include TRK, ROS1, or ALK kinase domains can drive tumorigenic potential through hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways leading to unconstrained cell proliferation. Entrectinib demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of cancer cell lines derived from multiple tumor types harboring NTRK , ROS1, and ALK fusion genes. Entrectinib demonstrated steady-state brain-to-plasma concentration ratios of 0.4 \u2013 2.2 in multiple animal species (mice, rats, and dogs) and demonstrated in vivo anti-tumor activity in mice with intracranial implantation of TRKA- and ALK-driven tumor cell lines. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Entrectinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are unknown. Cardiac Electrophysiology Across clinical trials, 3.1% of 355 patients, who received ROZLYTREK at doses ranging from 100 mg to 2600 mg daily under fasting or fed conditions (75% received 600 mg orally once daily) and had at least one post-baseline ECG assessment, experienced QTcF interval prolongation of > 60 ms after starting ROZLYTREK and 0.6% had a QTc interval > 500 ms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics for entrectinib and its pharmacologically active major circulating metabolite M5 were characterized in adult patients with ROS1 -positive NSCLC, NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumors, and healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib and M5 are linear and are not dose-dependent or time-dependent. Steady state is achieved within one week for entrectinib and two weeks for M5 following daily administration of ROZLYTREK. The pharmacokinetic parameters for entrectinib and M5 are described in Table 6 . Table 6: Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Entrectinib and Metabolite M5 Parameter Entrectinib Mean Geometric mean (% CV) M5 Mean (% CV) AUC D1 (nM*h) 31800 (48%) 10200 (82%) AUC ss (nM*h) 48000 (77%) 24000 (97%) C maxD1 (nM) 2250 (58%) 622 (79%) C maxss (nM) 3130 (80%) 1250 (90%) R acc(AUC) 1.55 (49%) 2.84 (93%) Absorption The maximum entrectinib plasma concentration was reached 4 \u2013 6 hours after oral administration of a 600 mg dose. Effect of Food A high-fat (approximately 50% of total caloric content), high-calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal did not have a significant effect on entrectinib exposure. Distribution Entrectinib and its active major metabolite M5 are both > 99% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. The estimated apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 551 L and 81.1 L for entrectinib and M5, respectively. Elimination The estimated apparent clearance (CL/F) was 19.6 L/h and 52.4 L/h for entrectinib and M5, respectively. The elimination half-lives of entrectinib and M5 were estimated to be 20 and 40 hours, respectively. Metabolism Entrectinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 (~76%). The active metabolite M5 (formed by CYP3A4) is the only major active circulating metabolite identified. M5 has similar pharmacological potency to entrectinib in vitro and circulating M5 exposures at steady-state in patients were 40% of the corresponding entrectinib exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of a single oral dose of [ 14 C]-labeled entrectinib, 83% of radioactivity was excreted in feces (36% of the dose as unchanged entrectinib and 22% as M5) with minimal excretion in urine (3%). Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were observed based on age (12 years to 86 years), sex, race (White, Asian and Black), body weight (32 to 130 kg), and mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to < 90 mL/min) and mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times ULN with aspartate aminotransferase > ULN or total bilirubin > 1.0 \u2013 1.5 times ULN with any aspartate aminotransferase) based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. The impact of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib is unknown. Hepatic Impairment Following administration of a single oral dose of ROZLYTREK 100 mg (1/6 of the recommended dose), the entrectinib AUC INF was increased by 39% for the mild, 39% for the moderate, and 23% for the severe hepatic impairment groups compared to the normal hepatic function group. The combined AUC last of entrectinib and M5 was increased by 16% for the mild, 16% for the moderate, and 4% for the severe hepatic impairment groups compared to the normal hepatic function group. Large variability in systemic exposure of entrectinib was observed in the hepatic impairment groups. Pediatric Patients The predicted systemic exposures for body surface area-based doses of 600 mg (BSA > 1.50 m 2 ), 500 mg (BSA of 1.11 to 1.50 m 2 ) and 400 mg (BSA of 0.91 to 1.10 m 2 ) in pediatric patients 12 years and older are comparable to the exposure in adults at the 600 mg dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Entrectinib: Coadministration of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) with a single 100 mg ROZLYTREK dose increased entrectinib AUC 0-INF by 6-fold and C max by 1.7-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Coadministration of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor with ROZLYTREK is predicted to increase entrectinib AUC 0-Tau by 3-fold and C max by 2.9-fold. Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Entrectinib: Coadministration of rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer) with a single 600 mg ROZLYTREK dose reduced entrectinib AUC 0-INF by 77% and C max by 56% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Coadministration of a moderate CYP3A inducer with ROZLYTREK is predicted to reduce entrectinib AUC 0-Tau by 56% and C max by 43%. Effect of Gastric Acid Reducing Drugs on Entrectinib : Coadministration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), lansoprazole with a single 600 mg ROZLYTREK dose reduced entrectinib AUC by 25% and C max by 23%. Effect of Entrectinib on CYP Substrates : Coadministration of ROZLYTREK 600 mg once daily with oral midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) in patients increased the midazolam AUC by 50% but reduced midazolam C max by 21% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Entrectinib on Transporters: Coadministration of a single 600 mg ROZLYTREK dose with digoxin [a sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate] increased digoxin C max by 28% and AUC by 18%.

To be included in this pooled subgroup, patients were required to have histologically confirmed, recurrent or metastatic, ROS1 -positive NSCLC, ECOG performance status \u2264 2, measurable disease per RECIST v 1.1, \u2265 18 months of follow-up from first post-treatment tumor assessment, and no prior therapy with a ROS1 inhibitor. Identification of ROS1 gene fusion in tumor specimens was prospectively determined in local laboratories using either a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), next-generation sequencing (NGS), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory-developed tests. All patients were assessed for CNS lesions at baseline. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Intracranial response according to RECIST v1.1 was assessed by BICR. Tumor assessments with imaging were performed every 8 weeks. Efficacy was assessed in 92 patients with ROS1 -positive NSCLC.

( 4 , 5.1 , 7.1 , 7.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions (including anaphylaxis ): May occur during or soon after administration. If symptoms occur, discontinue CINVANTI and do not reinitiate it. ( 4 , 5.2 ) Warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) : Risk of decreased INR of prothrombin time; monitor INR in 2\u2013week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following initiation of CINVANTI. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Hormonal Contraceptives : Efficacy of contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days following administration of aprepitant. Use effective alternative or back-up methods of non-hormonal contraception. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Clinically Significant CYP3A4 Drug Interactions Aprepitant is a substrate, weak-to-moderate (dose-dependent) inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Use of CINVANTI with other drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates may result in increased plasma concentration of the concomitant drug. Use of pimozide with CINVANTI is contraindicated due to the risk of significantly increased plasma concentrations of pimozide, potentially resulting in prolongation of the QT interval, a known adverse reaction of pimozide [see Contraindications (4) ] . Use of CINVANTI with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, diltiazem) may increase plasma concentrations of aprepitant and result in an increased risk of adverse reactions related to CINVANTI. Use of CINVANTI with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may result in a reduction in aprepitant plasma concentrations and decreased efficacy of CINVANTI. See Table 8 and Table 9 for a listing of potentially significant drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ]. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis during or soon after administration of CINVANTI have occurred. Symptoms including dyspnea, eye swelling, flushing, pruritus and wheezing have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients during and after administration. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue CINVANTI and administer appropriate medical therapy. Do not reinitiate CINVANTI in patients who experience these symptoms with previous use. 5.3 Decrease in INR with Concomitant Warfarin Coadministration of CINVANTI with warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, may result in a clinically significant decrease in the International Normalized Ratio (INR) of prothrombin time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Monitor the INR in patients on chronic warfarin therapy in the 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following initiation of CINVANTI with each chemotherapy cycle [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.4 Risk of Reduced Efficacy of Hormonal Contraceptives Upon coadministration with CINVANTI, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during administration of and for 28 days following the last dose of CINVANTI [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Advise patients to use effective alternative or back-up methods of non-hormonal contraception during treatment with CINVANTI and for 1 month following administration of CINVANTI or oral aprepitant, whichever is administered last [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] ."], "adverse_reactions": ["6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Most common adverse reactions are: Single-dose fosaprepitant with MEC (\u22652%): fatigue, diarrhea, neutropenia, asthenia, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, leukopenia, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, pain in extremity. ( 6.1 ) 3-day oral aprepitant with MEC (\u22651% and greater than standard therapy): fatigue and eructation. ( 6.1 ) Single-dose fosaprepitant with HEC: generally similar to 3-day oral aprepitant. In addition, infusion site reactions (3%) occurred. ( 6.1 ) Single-dose CINVANTI (\u22652%): headache and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Heron Therapeutics, Inc. at 1-844-437-6611 and www.CINVANTI.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of CINVANTI was evaluated as a single-dose in healthy subjects and established from adequate and well-controlled studies of intravenous fosaprepitant and/or oral aprepitant [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Adverse reactions observed in these adequate and well-controlled studies are described below. Safety of CINVANTI A total of 200 healthy subjects received a single 130 mg dose of CINVANTI as a 30-minute infusion. Adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of subjects were headache (3%) and fatigue (2%). The safety profile of CINVANTI in 50 healthy subjects who received a single 2-minute injection was similar to that seen with a 30-minute infusion. Single-Dose Intravenous Fosaprepitant -- HEC In an active-controlled clinical study in patients receiving HEC, safety was evaluated for 1143 patients receiving a single intravenous dose of fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant, compared to 1169 patients receiving a 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . When administered intravenously, fosaprepitant is converted to aprepitant within 30 minutes. The safety profile was generally similar to that seen in prior HEC studies with a 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant. However, infusion-site reactions occurred at a higher incidence in patients in the intravenous fosaprepitant group (3%) compared to those in the oral aprepitant group (0.5%). The reported infusion-site reactions included: infusion-site erythema, infusion-site pruritus, infusion-site pain, infusion-site induration and infusion-site thrombophlebitis. Adverse reactions associated with oral aprepitant may also be expected to occur with CINVANTI. See the full prescribing information for oral aprepitant for complete safety information. Single-Dose Intravenous Fosaprepitant -- MEC In an active-controlled clinical trial in patients receiving MEC, safety was evaluated in 504 patients receiving a single dose of intravenous fosaprepitant in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone (intravenous fosaprepitant regimen) compared to 497 patients receiving ondansetron and dexamethasone alone (standard therapy). The most common adverse reactions are listed in Table 5. Table 5. Most Common Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving MEC Reported in \u22652% of patients treated with the intravenous fosaprepitant regimen and at a greater incidence than standard therapy.

The infusion-site reactions included: infusion-site pain (1.2%, 0.4%), injection-site irritation (0.2%, 0.0%), vessel puncture-site pain (0.2%, 0.0%), and 8 infusion-site thrombophlebitis (0.6%, 0.0%), reported in the intravenous fosaprepitant regimen compared to standard therapy, respectively. 3-Day Oral Aprepitant -- MEC In 2 active-controlled clinical trials in patients receiving MEC, 868 patients were treated with a 3-day oral aprepitant regimen during Cycle 1 of chemotherapy and 686 of these patients continued into extensions for up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy. In both studies, oral aprepitant was given in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone (oral aprepitant regimen) and was compared to ondansetron and dexamethasone alone (standard therapy) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In the combined analysis of Cycle 1 data for these 2 studies, adverse reactions were reported in approximately 14% of patients treated with the aprepitant regimen compared with approximately 15% of patients treated with standard therapy. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 0.7% of patients treated with the aprepitant regimen compared with 0.2% of patients treated with standard therapy. The most common adverse reactions reported in patients treated with the oral aprepitant regimen with an incidence of at least 1% and greater than standard therapy are listed in Table 6. Table 6. Adverse Reactions (\u2265 1%) in Patients Receiving MEC with a Greater Incidence in the Oral 3-Day Aprepitant Regimen Relative to Standard Therapy Oral Aprepitant Regimen (N = 868) Standard Therapy (N = 846) Fatigue 1.4 0.9 Eructation 1.0 0.1 A listing of adverse reactions reported in less than 1% in patients treated with the oral aprepitant regimen that occurred at an incidence greater than in patients treated with standard therapy are presented in the Less Common Adverse Reactions subsection below.

( 4 , 5.1 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs Aprepitant is a substrate, weak-to-moderate (dose-dependent) inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Some substrates of CYP3A4 are contraindicated with CINVANTI [see Contraindications (4) ] . Dosage adjustment of some CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrates may be warranted, as shown in Table 8. Table 8. Effects of Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Pimozide Clinical Impact Increased pimozide exposure. Intervention CINVANTI is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . Benzodiazepines Clinical Impact Increased exposure to midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention Monitor for benzodiazepine-related adverse reactions. Dexamethasone Clinical Impact Increased dexamethasone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention Reduce the dose of oral dexamethasone by approximately 50% [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Methylprednisolone Clinical Impact Increased methylprednisolone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention Reduce the dose of oral methylprednisolone by approximately 50% on Days 1 and 2 for patients receiving HEC and on Day 1 for patients receiving MEC. Reduce the dose of intravenous methylprednisolone by 25% on Days 1 and 2 for patients receiving HEC and on Day 1 for patients receiving MEC. Chemotherapeutic Agents that are Metabolized by CYP3A4 Clinical Impact Increased exposure of the chemotherapeutic agent may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention Vinblastine, vincristine, or ifosfamide or other chemotherapeutic agents Monitor for chemotherapeutic-related adverse reactions. Etoposide, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel No dosage adjustment needed. Hormonal Contraceptives Clinical Impact Decreased hormonal exposure during administration of and for 28 days after administration of the last dose of aprepitant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention Effective alternative or back-up methods of contraception (such as condoms or spermicides) should be used during treatment with CINVANTI and for 1 month following administration of CINVANTI or oral aprepitant, whichever is administered last. Examples birth control pills, skin patches, implants, and certain IUDs CYP2C9 Substrates Warfarin Clinical Impact Decreased warfarin exposure and decreased prothrombin time (INR) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention In patients on chronic warfarin therapy, monitor the prothrombin time (INR) in the 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following administration of CINVANTI with each chemotherapy cycle. Other Antiemetic Agents 5-HT 3 Antagonists Clinical Impact No change in the exposure of the 5-HT 3 antagonist [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention No dosage adjustment needed. Examples ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Aprepitant Aprepitant is a CYP3A4 substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Co-administration of CINVANTI with drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may result in increased or decreased plasma concentrations of aprepitant, respectively, as shown in Table 9. Table 9. Effects of Other Drugs on Pharmacokinetics of Aprepitant Moderate to Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Significantly increased exposure of aprepitant may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with CINVANTI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention Avoid concomitant use of CINVANTI. Examples Moderate inhibitor : diltiazem Strong inhibitors : ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact Substantially decreased exposure of aprepitant in patients chronically taking a strong CYP3A4 inducer may decrease the efficacy of CINVANTI [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].

( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on CINVANTI use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Avoid use of CINVANTI in pregnant women due to the alcohol content (see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in rats or rabbits exposed during the period of organogenesis to systemic drug concentrations (area under the plasma-concentration time curve [AUC]) of aprepitant approximately equivalent to the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) of CINVANTI 130 mg (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions CINVANTI contains alcohol. Published studies have demonstrated that alcohol is associated with fetal harm including central nervous system abnormalities, behavioral disorders, and impaired intellectual development. There is no safe level of alcohol exposure in pregnancy; therefore, avoid use of CINVANTI in pregnant women. Data Animal Data In embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, aprepitant was administered during the period of organogenesis at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg twice daily (rats) and up to the maximum tolerated dose of 25 mg/kg/day (rabbits). No embryofetal lethality or malformations were observed at any dose level in either species. The exposures (AUC) in pregnant rats at 1000 mg/kg twice daily and in pregnant rabbits at 125 mg/kg/day were approximately equivalent to the exposure at the RHD of CINVANTI 130 mg. Aprepitant crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of aprepitant in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Aprepitant is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for CINVANTI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from CINVANTI or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Upon administration of CINVANTI, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced. Advise females of reproductive potential using hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative or back-up non-hormonal contraceptive (such as condoms or spermicides) during treatment with CINVANTI and for 1 month following the last dose of CINVANTI or oral aprepitant, whichever is administered last [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CINVANTI have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1649 adult cancer patients treated with intravenous fosaprepitant in HEC and MEC clinical studies, 27% were aged 65 and over, while 5% were aged 75 and over. Other reported clinical experience with fosaprepitant and/or oral aprepitant has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, use caution when dosing elderly patients as they have a greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of aprepitant in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those of healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 9). There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9).

Aprepitant is a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK 1 ) receptor antagonist, an antiemetic agent, chemically described as 5-[[(2 R ,3 S )-2-[(1 R )-1-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethoxy]-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-morpholinyl]methyl]-1,2-dihydro-3 H -1,2,4-triazol-3-one. Its empirical formula is C 23 H 21 F 7 N 4 O 3 , and its structural formula is: Aprepitant is a white to off-white crystalline solid, with a molecular weight of 534.43. It is practically insoluble in water. Aprepitant is sparingly soluble in ethanol and isopropyl acetate and slightly soluble in acetonitrile. CINVANTI (aprepitant) injectable emulsion is a sterile, opaque, off-white to amber liquid in a single-dose vial for intravenous use. Each vial contains 130 mg aprepitant in 18 mL of emulsion. The emulsion also contains the following inactive ingredients: egg lecithin (2602 mg), dehydrated alcohol (513 mg), sodium oleate (87 mg), soybean oil (1734 mg), sucrose (973 mg), and water for injection (12142 mg). Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK 1 ) receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin (5-HT 3 ), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors. Aprepitant has been shown in animal models to inhibit emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, via central actions. Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies with aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK 1 receptors. Animal and human studies show that aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT 3 -receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin-induced emesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled, thorough QTc study, a single 200 mg intravenous dose of fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant, had no effect on the QTc interval. In a cross-study comparison, maximum aprepitant concentrations (C max ) after a single 200 mg dose of fosaprepitant were 1.04- and 1.5-fold higher than that achieved with CINVANTI 130 mg dose and 100 mg dose given as a 30-minute infusion, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of a single intravenous 130 mg dose of CINVANTI administered as a 2-minute injection or 100 mg or 130 mg dose of CINVANTI administered as a 30-minute infusion to healthy subjects are summarized in Table 10. Table 10. Aprepitant Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Mean (\u00b1 Standard Deviation)) After Single Dose Intravenous Administration of CINVANTI CINVANTI 130 mg 2-minute intravenous injection CINVANTI 130 mg 30-minute intravenous infusion CINVANTI 100 mg 30-minute intravenous infusion AUC 0-72hr (mcg\u2219hr/mL) 45.6 (\u00b1 15.5) 43.9 (\u00b1 12.7) 27.8 (\u00b1 6.5) C max (mcg/mL) 13.9 (\u00b13.8) 6.1 (\u00b1 1.5) 4.3 (\u00b1 1.2) Distribution Aprepitant is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vd ss ) was approximately 70 L in humans. Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Elimination Metabolism Aprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Metabolism is largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side chains. No metabolism by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1 was detected. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for approximately 24% of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single oral 300 mg dose of [ 14 C]-aprepitant, indicating a substantial presence of metabolites in the plasma. Seven metabolites of aprepitant, which are only weakly active, have been identified in human plasma. Excretion Aprepitant is eliminated primarily by metabolism; aprepitant is not renally excreted. The apparent terminal half-life ranged from approximately 9 to 13 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 21% higher on Day 1 and 36% higher on Day 5 in elderly (65 years and older) relative to younger adults. The C max was 10% higher on Day 1 and 24% higher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Male and Female Patients Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC 0-24hr and C max are 9% and 17% higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is 25% lower in females as compared with males and T max occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Racial or Ethnic Groups Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC 0-24hr and C max are approximately 27% and 19% higher in Hispanics as compared with Caucasians. The AUC 0-24hr and C max were 74% and 47% higher in Asians as compared to Caucasians. There was no difference in AUC 0-24hr or C max between Caucasians and Blacks. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment A single 240 mg oral dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis. In patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC 0-\u221e of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) decreased by 21% and C max decreased by 32%, relative to healthy subjects (creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault method). In patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, the AUC 0-\u221e of total aprepitant decreased by 42% and C max decreased by 32%. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC of pharmacologically active unbound drug was not significantly affected in patients with renal impairment compared with healthy subjects. Hemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2% of the dose was recovered in the dialysate. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of a single 125 mg oral dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3 to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6), the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 11% lower on Day 1 and 36% lower on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 10% higher on Day 1 and 18% higher on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. These differences in AUC 0-24hr are not considered clinically meaningful. There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Body Mass Index (BMI) For every 5 kg/m 2 increase in BMI AUC 0-24hr and C max of aprepitant decrease by 9% and 10%. BMI of subjects in the analysis ranged from 18 kg/m 2 to 36 kg/m 2 . This change is not considered clinically meaningful. Drug Interactions Studies Aprepitant is a substrate, and a weak-to-moderate (dose-dependent) inhibitor of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP3A4, and CYP2C9. Aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P-glycoprotein transporter. Effects of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates: Midazolam: Fosaprepitant 150 mg (corresponding to CINVANTI 130 mg) administered as a single intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC 0-\u221e of midazolam by approximately 1.8-fold on Day 1 and had no effect on Day 4 when midazolam was coadministered as a single oral dose of 2 mg on Days 1 and 4. Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone: Fosaprepitant administered as a single 150 mg (corresponding to CINVANTI 130 mg) intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC 0-24hr of dexamethasone, administered as a single 8 mg oral dose on Days 1, 2, and Day 3, by approximately 2-fold on Days 1 and 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Methylprednisolone: When oral aprepitant as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) was administered with intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg on Day 1 and oral methylprednisolone 40 mg on Days 2 and 3, the AUC of methylprednisolone was increased by 1.34-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Chemotherapeutic agents: Docetaxel: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Vinorelbine: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine to a clinically significant degree [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . CYP2C9 substrates (Warfarin, Tolbutamide): Warfarin: A single 125 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to subjects who were stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy. Although there was no effect of oral aprepitant on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin determined on Day 3, there was a 34% decrease in S(-) warfarin trough concentration accompanied by a 14% decrease in the prothrombin time (reported as International Normalized Ratio or INR) 5 days after completion of dosing with oral aprepitant [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Tolbutamide: Oral aprepitant, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of tolbutamide by 23% on Day 4, 28% on Day 8, and 15% on Day 15, when a single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant and on Days 4, 8, and 15. This effect was not considered clinically important. Other Drugs: Oral contraceptives: When oral aprepitant was administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) with ondansetron and dexamethasone, and coadministered with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, the trough concentrations of both ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were reduced by as much as 64% for 3 weeks post-treatment [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. P-glycoprotein substrates: Aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P-glycoprotein transporter, as demonstrated by the lack of interaction of oral aprepitant with digoxin in a clinical drug interaction study. 5-HT 3 antagonists : In clinical drug interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of dolasetron). Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant Rifampin: When a single 375 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Ketoconazole: When a single 125 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Diltiazem: In a study in 10 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 100 mg of fosaprepitant as an intravenous infusion with 120 mg of diltiazem, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor administered three times daily, resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the aprepitant AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in the diltiazem AUC. When fosaprepitant was administered with diltiazem, the mean maximum decrease in diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater than that observed with diltiazem alone [24.3 \u00b1 10.2 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 15.6 \u00b1 4.1 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. The mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure was also greater after co-administration of diltiazem with fosaprepitant than administration of diltiazem alone [29.5 \u00b1 7.9 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 23.8 \u00b1 4.8 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. Co-administration of fosaprepitant and diltiazem; however, did not result in any additional clinically significant changes in heart rate or PR interval, beyond those changes observed with diltiazem alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Paroxetine: Coadministration of once daily doses of oral aprepitant 170 mg, with paroxetine 20 mg once daily, resulted in a decrease in AUC by approximately 25% and C max by approximately 20% of both aprepitant and paroxetine.

Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin (5-HT 3 ), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors. Aprepitant has been shown in animal models to inhibit emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, via central actions. Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies with aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK 1 receptors. Animal and human studies show that aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT 3 -receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin-induced emesis."], "pharmacodynamics": ["12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled, thorough QTc study, a single 200 mg intravenous dose of fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant, had no effect on the QTc interval. In a cross-study comparison, maximum aprepitant concentrations (C max ) after a single 200 mg dose of fosaprepitant were 1.04- and 1.5-fold higher than that achieved with CINVANTI 130 mg dose and 100 mg dose given as a 30-minute infusion, respectively."], "pharmacokinetics": ["12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of a single intravenous 130 mg dose of CINVANTI administered as a 2-minute injection or 100 mg or 130 mg dose of CINVANTI administered as a 30-minute infusion to healthy subjects are summarized in Table 10. Table 10. Aprepitant Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Mean (\u00b1 Standard Deviation)) After Single Dose Intravenous Administration of CINVANTI CINVANTI 130 mg 2-minute intravenous injection CINVANTI 130 mg 30-minute intravenous infusion CINVANTI 100 mg 30-minute intravenous infusion AUC 0-72hr (mcg\u2219hr/mL) 45.6 (\u00b1 15.5) 43.9 (\u00b1 12.7) 27.8 (\u00b1 6.5) C max (mcg/mL) 13.9 (\u00b13.8) 6.1 (\u00b1 1.5) 4.3 (\u00b1 1.2) Distribution Aprepitant is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vd ss ) was approximately 70 L in humans. Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Elimination Metabolism Aprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Metabolism is largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side chains. No metabolism by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1 was detected. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for approximately 24% of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single oral 300 mg dose of [ 14 C]-aprepitant, indicating a substantial presence of metabolites in the plasma. Seven metabolites of aprepitant, which are only weakly active, have been identified in human plasma. Excretion Aprepitant is eliminated primarily by metabolism; aprepitant is not renally excreted. The apparent terminal half-life ranged from approximately 9 to 13 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 21% higher on Day 1 and 36% higher on Day 5 in elderly (65 years and older) relative to younger adults. The C max was 10% higher on Day 1 and 24% higher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Male and Female Patients Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC 0-24hr and C max are 9% and 17% higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is 25% lower in females as compared with males and T max occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Racial or Ethnic Groups Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC 0-24hr and C max are approximately 27% and 19% higher in Hispanics as compared with Caucasians. The AUC 0-24hr and C max were 74% and 47% higher in Asians as compared to Caucasians. There was no difference in AUC 0-24hr or C max between Caucasians and Blacks. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment A single 240 mg oral dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis. In patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC 0-\u221e of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) decreased by 21% and C max decreased by 32%, relative to healthy subjects (creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault method). In patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, the AUC 0-\u221e of total aprepitant decreased by 42% and C max decreased by 32%. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC of pharmacologically active unbound drug was not significantly affected in patients with renal impairment compared with healthy subjects. Hemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2% of the dose was recovered in the dialysate. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of a single 125 mg oral dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3 to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6), the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 11% lower on Day 1 and 36% lower on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 10% higher on Day 1 and 18% higher on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. These differences in AUC 0-24hr are not considered clinically meaningful. There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Body Mass Index (BMI) For every 5 kg/m 2 increase in BMI AUC 0-24hr and C max of aprepitant decrease by 9% and 10%. BMI of subjects in the analysis ranged from 18 kg/m 2 to 36 kg/m 2 . This change is not considered clinically meaningful. Drug Interactions Studies Aprepitant is a substrate, and a weak-to-moderate (dose-dependent) inhibitor of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP3A4, and CYP2C9. Aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P-glycoprotein transporter. Effects of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates: Midazolam: Fosaprepitant 150 mg (corresponding to CINVANTI 130 mg) administered as a single intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC 0-\u221e of midazolam by approximately 1.8-fold on Day 1 and had no effect on Day 4 when midazolam was coadministered as a single oral dose of 2 mg on Days 1 and 4. Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone: Fosaprepitant administered as a single 150 mg (corresponding to CINVANTI 130 mg) intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC 0-24hr of dexamethasone, administered as a single 8 mg oral dose on Days 1, 2, and Day 3, by approximately 2-fold on Days 1 and 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Methylprednisolone: When oral aprepitant as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) was administered with intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg on Day 1 and oral methylprednisolone 40 mg on Days 2 and 3, the AUC of methylprednisolone was increased by 1.34-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Chemotherapeutic agents: Docetaxel: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Vinorelbine: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine to a clinically significant degree [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . CYP2C9 substrates (Warfarin, Tolbutamide): Warfarin: A single 125 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to subjects who were stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy. Although there was no effect of oral aprepitant on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin determined on Day 3, there was a 34% decrease in S(-) warfarin trough concentration accompanied by a 14% decrease in the prothrombin time (reported as International Normalized Ratio or INR) 5 days after completion of dosing with oral aprepitant [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Tolbutamide: Oral aprepitant, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of tolbutamide by 23% on Day 4, 28% on Day 8, and 15% on Day 15, when a single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant and on Days 4, 8, and 15. This effect was not considered clinically important. Other Drugs: Oral contraceptives: When oral aprepitant was administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) with ondansetron and dexamethasone, and coadministered with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, the trough concentrations of both ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were reduced by as much as 64% for 3 weeks post-treatment [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. P-glycoprotein substrates: Aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P-glycoprotein transporter, as demonstrated by the lack of interaction of oral aprepitant with digoxin in a clinical drug interaction study. 5-HT 3 antagonists : In clinical drug interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of dolasetron). Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant Rifampin: When a single 375 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Ketoconazole: When a single 125 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Diltiazem: In a study in 10 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 100 mg of fosaprepitant as an intravenous infusion with 120 mg of diltiazem, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor administered three times daily, resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the aprepitant AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in the diltiazem AUC. When fosaprepitant was administered with diltiazem, the mean maximum decrease in diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater than that observed with diltiazem alone [24.3 \u00b1 10.2 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 15.6 \u00b1 4.1 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. The mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure was also greater after co-administration of diltiazem with fosaprepitant than administration of diltiazem alone [29.5 \u00b1 7.9 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 23.8 \u00b1 4.8 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. Co-administration of fosaprepitant and diltiazem; however, did not result in any additional clinically significant changes in heart rate or PR interval, beyond those changes observed with diltiazem alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Paroxetine: Coadministration of once daily doses of oral aprepitant 170 mg, with paroxetine 20 mg once daily, resulted in a decrease in AUC by approximately 25% and C max by approximately 20% of both aprepitant and paroxetine.

Below is a description of the results of these adequate and well-controlled studies of fosaprepitant/aprepitant in these conditions. 14.1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with HEC In a randomized, parallel, double-blind, active-controlled study, 150 mg fosaprepitant as a single intravenous infusion (N = 1147) was compared to a 3-day oral aprepitant regimen (N = 1175) in patients receiving a HEC regimen that included cisplatin (\u226570 mg/m 2 ). All patients in both groups received dexamethasone and ondansetron (see Table 11 ) Patient demographics were similar between the two treatment groups.

Patients (N = 866) were randomized to either the aprepitant regimen (N = 438) or standard therapy (N = 428). The treatment regimens are defined in Table 15. In this study, the most common chemotherapy combinations were cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin (61%); and cyclophosphamide plus epirubicin and fluorouracil (22%). Of the 438 patients who were randomized to receive the oral aprepitant regimen, 99.5% were women. Of these, approximately 80% were White, 8% Black, 8% Asian, 4% Hispanic, and < 1% Other. The aprepitant-treated patients in this clinical study ranged from 25 to 78 years of age, with a mean age of 53 years; 70 patients were 65 years or older, with 12 patients being over 74 years.

No Nausea 33 33 NS No Significant Nausea 61 56 NS No Rescue Therapy 59 56 NS Complete Protection 43 37 NS In this study, a statistically significantly (p = 0.015) higher proportion of patients receiving the oral aprepitant regimen in Cycle 1 had a complete response (primary endpoint) during the overall phase compared with patients receiving standard therapy. The difference between treatment groups was primarily driven by the \"No Emesis Endpoint\", a principal component of this composite primary endpoint. In addition, a higher proportion of patients receiving the oral aprepitant regimen in Cycle 1 had a complete response during the acute (0 to 24 hours) and delayed (25 to 120 hours) phases compared with patients receiving standard therapy; however, the treatment group differences failed to reach statistical significance, after multiplicity adjustments. Additional Patient-Reported Outcomes: In this study, in patients receiving MEC, the impact of nausea and vomiting on patients' daily lives was assessed in Cycle 1 using the FLIE. A higher proportion of patients receiving the oral aprepitant regimen reported minimal or no impact on daily life (64% versus 56%). This difference between treatment groups was primarily driven by the \"No Vomiting Domain\" of this composite endpoint. Multiple-Cycle Extension: Patients receiving MEC were permitted to continue into the Multiple-Cycle extension of the study for up to 3 additional cycles of chemotherapy. Antiemetic effect for patients receiving the aprepitant regimen is maintained during all cycles. Oral Aprepitant Postmarketing Trial: In another multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical study in 848 cancer patients, the 3-day oral aprepitant regimen (N = 430) was compared with a standard of care therapy (N = 418) in patients receiving a MEC regimen that included any intravenous dose of oxaliplatin, carboplatin, epirubicin, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, daunorubicin, doxorubicin; intravenous cyclophosphamide (less than 1500 mg/m 2 ); or intravenous cytarabine (greater than 1 g/m 2 ). Of the 430 patients who were randomized to receive the oral aprepitant regimen, 76% were women and 24% were men. The distribution by race was 67% White, 6% Black or African American, 11% Asian, and 12% multiracial. Classified by ethnicity, 36% were Hispanic and 64% were non-Hispanic. The aprepitant-treated patients in this clinical study ranged from 22 to 85 years of age, with a mean age of 57 years; approximately 59% of the patients were 55 years or older with 32 patients being over 74 years. Patients receiving the aprepitant regimen were receiving chemotherapy for a variety of tumor types including 50% with breast cancer, 21% with gastrointestinal cancers including colorectal cancer, 13% with lung cancer and 6% with gynecological cancers. The antiemetic activity of aprepitant was evaluated based on no vomiting (with or without rescue therapy) in the overall period (0 to 120 hours post-chemotherapy) and complete response (defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy) in the overall period. A summary of the key results from this study is shown in Table 17. Table 17. Percent of Patients Receiving MEC Responding by Treatment Group for Study 2 \u2013 Cycle 1 ENDPOINTS Oral Aprepitant Regimen (N = 430) N = Number of patients who received chemotherapy treatment, study drug, and had at least one post-treatment efficacy evaluation. % Standard Therapy (N = 418) % p-Value No Vomiting Overall 76 62 < 0.0001 Complete Response Overall 69 56 0.0003 In this study, a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients receiving the oral aprepitant regimen (76%) in Cycle 1 had no vomiting during the overall phase compared with patients receiving standard therapy (62%). In addition, a higher proportion of patients receiving the aprepitant regimen (69%) in Cycle 1 had a complete response in the overall phase (0 to 120 hours) compared with patients receiving standard therapy (56%). In the acute phase (0 to 24 hours following initiation of chemotherapy), a higher proportion of patients receiving aprepitant compared to patients receiving standard therapy were observed to have no vomiting (92% and 84%, respectively) and complete response (89% and 80%, respectively). In the delayed phase (25 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy), a higher proportion of patients receiving aprepitant compared to patients receiving standard therapy were observed to have no vomiting (78% and 67%, respectively) and complete response (71% and 61%, respectively). In a subgroup analysis by tumor type, a numerically higher proportion of patients receiving aprepitant were observed to have no vomiting and complete response compared to patients receiving standard therapy. For gender, the difference in complete response rates between the aprepitant and standard regimen groups was 14% in females (64.5% and 50.3%, respectively) and 4% in males (82.2% and 78.2%, respectively) during the overall phase.

In animal studies, disopyramide phosphate decreases the rate of diastolic depolarization (phase 4) in cells with augmented automaticity, decreases the upstroke velocity (phase 0) and increases the action potential duration of normal cardiac cells, decreases the disparity in refractoriness between infarcted and adjacent normally perfused myocardium, and has no effect on alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors. Electrophysiology In man, disopyramide phosphate at therapeutic plasma levels shortens the sinus node recovery time, lengthens the effective refractory period of the atrium, and has a minimal effect on the effective refractory period of the AV node. Little effect has been shown on AV-nodal and His-Purkinje conduction times or QRS duration. However, prolongation of conduction in accessory pathways occurs. Hemodynamics At recommended oral doses, disopyramide phosphate rarely produces significant alterations of blood pressure in patients without congestive heart failure (see Warnings ). With intravenous disopyramide phosphate, either increases in systolic/diastolic or decreases in systolic blood pressure have been reported, depending on the infusion rate and the patient population. Intravenous disopyramide phosphate may cause cardiac depression with an approximate mean 10% reduction of cardiac output, which is more pronounced in patients with cardiac dysfunction. Anticholinergic Activity The in vitro anticholinergic activity of disopyramide phosphate is approximately 0.06% that of atropine; however, the usual dose for disopyramide phosphate is 150 mg every 6 hours compared to 0.4 to 0.6 mg for atropine (see Warnings and Adverse Reactions for anticholinergic side effects). Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of immediate-release capsules, disopyramide phosphate is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, and peak plasma levels are usually attained within 2 hours. The usual therapeutic plasma levels of disopyramide base are 2 to 4 mcg/ml, and at these concentrations protein binding varies from 50% to 65%. Because of concentration-dependent protein binding, it is difficult to predict the concentration of the free drug when total drug is measured. The mean plasma half-life of disopyramide in healthy humans is 6.7 hours (range of 4 to 10 hours). In six patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 40 ml/min), disopyramide half-life values were 8 to 18 hours. After the oral administration of 200 mg of disopyramide to 10 cardiac patients with borderline to moderate heart failure, the time to peak serum concentration of 2.3 \u00b1 1.5 hours (mean \u00b1 SD) was increased, and the mean peak serum concentration of 4.8 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/ml was higher than in healthy volunteers. After intravenous administration in these same patients, the mean elimination half-life was 9.7 \u00b1 4.2 hours (range in healthy volunteers of 4.4 to 7.8 hours). In a second study of the oral administration of disopyramide to 7 patients with heart disease, including left ventricular dysfunction, the mean plasma half-life was slightly prolonged to 7.8 \u00b1 1.9 hours (range of 5 to 9.5 hours). In healthy men, about 50% of a given dose of disopyramide is excreted in the urine as the unchanged drug, about 20% as the mono-N-dealkylated metabolite, and 10% as the other metabolites. The plasma concentration of the major metabolite is approximately one tenth that of disopyramide. Altering the urinary pH in man does not affect the plasma half-life of disopyramide. Following multiple doses, steady-state plasma levels of between 2 and 4 mcg/ml were attained following 150 mg every-6-hour dosing with immediate-release capsules. Drug Interactions Effects of other drugs on disopyramide pharmacokinetics In vitro metabolic studies indicated that disopyramide is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 and that inhibitors of this enzyme may result in elevation of plasma levels of disopyramide.

Because of the proarrhythmic effects of disopyramide phosphate, its use with lesser arrhythmias is generally not recommended. Treatment of patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature contractions should be avoided. Initiation of disopyramide phosphate treatment, as with other antiarrhythmic agents used to treat life-threatening arrhythmias, should be carried out in the hospital. Antiarrhythmic drugs have not been shown to enhance survival in patients with ventricular arrhythmias."], "contraindications": ["CONTRAINDICATIONS Disopyramide phosphate is contraindicated in the presence of cardiogenic shock, preexisting second-or third-degree AV block (if no pacemaker is present), congenital Q-T prolongation, or known hypersensitivity to the drug."], "warnings": ["Warnings Mortality In the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a long-term, multi-center, randomized, double-blind study in patients with asymptomatic non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who had had a myocardial infarction more than 6 days but less than 2 years previously, an excessive mortality or non-fatal cardiac arrest rate (7.7%) was seen in patients treated with encainide or flecainide compared with that seen in patients assigned to carefully matched placebo-treated groups (3.0%). The average duration of treatment with encainide or flecainide in this study was 10 months. The applicability of the CAST results to other populations (e.g., those without recent myocardial infarction) is uncertain. Considering the known proarrhythmic properties of disopyramide phosphate and the lack of evidence of improved survival for any antiarrhythmic drug in patients without life-threatening arrhythmias, the use of disopyramide phosphate as well as other antiarrhythmic agents should be reserved for patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Negative Inotropic Properties Heart Failure/Hypotension Disopyramide phosphate may cause or worsen congestive heart failure or produce severe hypotension as a consequence of its negative inotropic properties. Hypotension has been observed primarily in patients with primary cardiomyopathy or inadequately compensated congestive heart failure. Disopyramide phosphate should not be used in patients with uncompensated or marginally compensated congestive heart failure or hypotension unless the congestive heart failure or hypotension is secondary to cardiac arrhythmia. Patients with a history of heart failure may be treated with disopyramide phosphate, but careful attention must be given to the maintenance of cardiac function, including optimal digitalization. If hypotension occurs or congestive heart failure worsens, disopyramide phosphate should be discontinued and, if necessary, restarted at a lower dosage only after adequate cardiac compensation has been established. QRS Widening Although it is unusual, significant widening (greater than 25%) of the QRS complex may occur during disopyramide phosphate administration; in such cases, disopyramide phosphate should be discontinued. Q-T Prolongation As with other Type 1 antiarrhythmic drugs, prolongation of the Q-T interval (corrected) and worsening of the arrhythmia, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, may occur. Patients who have evidenced prolongation of the Q-T interval in response to quinidine may be at particular risk. As with other Type 1A antiarrhythmics, disopyramide phosphate has been associated with torsade de pointes. If a Q-T prolongation of greater than 25% is observed and if ectopy continues, the patient should be monitored closely, and consideration given to discontinuing disopyramide phosphate. Hypoglycemia In rare instances significant lowering of blood-glucose values has been reported during disopyramide phosphate administration. The physician should be alert to this possibility, especially in patients with congestive heart failure, chronic malnutrition, hepatic, renal or other diseases, or drugs (e.g., beta-adrenoceptor blockers, alcohol) which could compromise preservation of the normal glucoregulatory mechanisms in the absence of food. In these patients the blood-glucose levels should be carefully followed. Concomitant Antiarrhythmic Therapy The concomitant use of disopyramide phosphate with other Type 1A antiarrhythmic agents (such as quinidine or procainamide), Type 1C antiarrhythmics (such as encainide, flecainide or propafenone), and/or propranolol should be reserved for patients with life-threatening arrhythmias who are demonstrably unresponsive to single-agent antiarrhythmic therapy. Such use may produce serious negative inotropic effects, or may excessively prolong conduction. This should be considered particularly in patients with any degree of cardiac decompensation or those with a prior history thereof. Patients receiving more than one antiarrhythmic drug must be carefully monitored. Heart Block If first-degree heart block develops in a patient receiving disopyramide phosphate, the dosage should be reduced. If the block persists despite reduction of dosage, continuation of the drug must depend upon weighing the benefit being obtained against the risk of higher degrees of heart block. Development of second- or third-degree AV block or unifascicular, bifascicular, or trifascicular block requires discontinuation of disopyramide phosphate therapy, unless the ventricular rate is adequately controlled by a temporary or implanted ventricular pacemaker. Anticholinergic Activity Because of its anticholinergic activity, disopyramide phosphate should not be used in patients with glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, or urinary retention unless adequate overriding measures are taken; these consist of the topical application of potent miotics (e.g., pilocarpine) for patients with glaucoma, and catheter drainage or operative relief for patients with urinary retention. Urinary retention may occur in patients of either sex as a consequence of disopyramide phosphate administration, but males with benign prostatic hypertrophy are at particular risk. In patients with a family history of glaucoma, intraocular pressure should be measured before initiating disopyramide phosphate therapy. Disopyramide phosphate should be used with special care in patients with myasthenia gravis since its anticholinergic properties could precipitate a myasthenic crisis in such patients."], "boxed_warning": ["Mortality In the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a long-term, multi-center, randomized, double-blind study in patients with asymptomatic non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who had had a myocardial infarction more than 6 days but less than 2 years previously, an excessive mortality or non-fatal cardiac arrest rate (7.7%) was seen in patients treated with encainide or flecainide compared with that seen in patients assigned to carefully matched placebo-treated groups (3.0%).

Conduction Abnormalities Care should be taken when prescribing disopyramide phosphate for patients with sick sinus syndrome (bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), or bundle branch block. The effect of disopyramide phosphate in these conditions is uncertain at present. Cardiomyopathy Patients with myocarditis or other cardiomyopathy may develop significant hypotension in response to the usual dosage of disopyramide phosphate, probably due to cardiodepressant mechanisms. Therefore, a loading dose of disopyramide phosphate should not be given to such patients, and initial dosage and subsequent dosage adjustments should be made under close supervision (see Dosage and Administration ). Renal Impairment More than 50% of disopyramide is excreted in the urine unchanged. Therefore disopyramide phosphate dosage should be reduced in patients with impaired renal function (see Dosage and Administration ). The electrocardiogram should be carefully monitored for prolongation of PR interval, evidence of QRS widening, or other signs of overdosage (see Overdosage ). Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment also causes an increase in the plasma half-life of disopyramide. Dosage should be reduced for patients with such impairment. The electrocardiogram should be carefully monitored for signs of overdosage (see Overdosage ). Patients with cardiac dysfunction have a higher potential for hepatic impairment; this should be considered when administering disopyramide phosphate. Potassium Imbalance Antiarrhythmic drugs may be ineffective in patients with hypokalemia, and their toxic effects may be enhanced in patients with hyperkalemia. Therefore, potassium abnormalities should be corrected before starting disopyramide phosphate therapy. Drug Interactions If phenytoin or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with disopyramide phosphate, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur. Monitoring of disopyramide plasma levels is recommended in such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy. Other antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, lidocaine, propranolol) have occasionally been used concurrently with disopyramide phosphate. Excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the Q-T interval may occur in these situations (see Warnings ). In healthy subjects, no significant drug-drug interaction was observed when disopyramide phosphate was coadministered with either propranolol or diazepam. Concomitant administration of disopyramide phosphate and quinidine resulted in slight increases in plasma disopyramide levels and slight decreases in plasma quinidine levels. Disopyramide phosphate does not increase serum digoxin levels. Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, disopyramide should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after verapamil administration. Although potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) have not been studied clinically, in vitro studies have shown that erythromycin and oleandomycin inhibit the metabolism of disopyramide. Cases of life-threatening interactions have been reported for disopyramide when given with clarithromycin and erythromycin indicating that coadministration of disopyramide with inhibitors of cytochrome 3A4 could result in potentially fatal interaction. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Eighteen months of disopyramide phosphate administration to rats, at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day (about 30 times the usual daily human dose of 600 mg/day, assuming a patient weight of at least 50 kg), revealed no evidence of carcinogenic potential. An evaluation of mutagenic potential by Ames test was negative. Disopyramide phosphate, at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day, did not adversely affect fertility of rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Disopyramide phosphate was associated with decreased numbers of implantation sites and decreased growth and survival of pups when administered to pregnant rats at 250 mg/kg/day (20 or more times the usual daily human dose of 12 mg/kg, assuming a patient weight of at least 50 kg), a level at which weight gain and food consumption of dams were also reduced. Increased resorption rates were reported in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day (5 or more times the usual daily human dose). Effects on implantation, pup growth, and survival were not evaluated in rabbits. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Disopyramide phosphate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Disopyramide phosphate has been reported to stimulate contractions of the pregnant uterus. Disopyramide has been found in human fetal blood. Labor and Delivery It is not known whether the use of disopyramide phosphate during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, or whether it prolongs the duration of labor or increases the need for forceps delivery or other obstetric intervention. Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown that the concentration of disopyramide and its metabolites is between one and three times greater in milk than it is in plasma. Following oral administration, disopyramide has been detected in human milk at a concentration not exceeding that in plasma. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from disopyramide phosphate, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established (see Dosage and Administration ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of disopyramide phosphate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Because of its anticholinergic activity, disopyramide phosphate should not be used in patients with glaucoma, urinary retention, or benign prostatic hypertrophy (medical conditions commonly associated with the elderly) unless adequate overriding measures are taken (see Warnings: Anticholinergic Activity ). In the event of increased anticholinergic side effects, plasma levels of disopyramide should be monitored and the dose of the drug adjusted accordingly. A reduction of the dose by one third, from the recommended 600 mg/day to 400 mg/day, would be reasonable, without changing the dosing interval. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see Precautions: Renal Impairment and Dosage and Administration )."], "general_precautions": ["General Atrial Tachyarrhythmias Patients with atrial flutter or fibrillation should be digitalized prior to disopyramide phosphate administration to ensure that drug-induced enhancement of AV conduction does not result in an increase of ventricular rate beyond physiologically acceptable limits. Conduction Abnormalities Care should be taken when prescribing disopyramide phosphate for patients with sick sinus syndrome (bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), or bundle branch block. The effect of disopyramide phosphate in these conditions is uncertain at present. Cardiomyopathy Patients with myocarditis or other cardiomyopathy may develop significant hypotension in response to the usual dosage of disopyramide phosphate, probably due to cardiodepressant mechanisms. Therefore, a loading dose of disopyramide phosphate should not be given to such patients, and initial dosage and subsequent dosage adjustments should be made under close supervision (see Dosage and Administration ). Renal Impairment More than 50% of disopyramide is excreted in the urine unchanged. Therefore disopyramide phosphate dosage should be reduced in patients with impaired renal function (see Dosage and Administration ). The electrocardiogram should be carefully monitored for prolongation of PR interval, evidence of QRS widening, or other signs of overdosage (see Overdosage ). Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment also causes an increase in the plasma half-life of disopyramide. Dosage should be reduced for patients with such impairment. The electrocardiogram should be carefully monitored for signs of overdosage (see Overdosage ). Patients with cardiac dysfunction have a higher potential for hepatic impairment; this should be considered when administering disopyramide phosphate. Potassium Imbalance Antiarrhythmic drugs may be ineffective in patients with hypokalemia, and their toxic effects may be enhanced in patients with hyperkalemia. Therefore, potassium abnormalities should be corrected before starting disopyramide phosphate therapy."], "drug_interactions": ["Drug Interactions If phenytoin or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with disopyramide phosphate, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur. Monitoring of disopyramide plasma levels is recommended in such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy. Other antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, lidocaine, propranolol) have occasionally been used concurrently with disopyramide phosphate. Excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the Q-T interval may occur in these situations (see Warnings ). In healthy subjects, no significant drug-drug interaction was observed when disopyramide phosphate was coadministered with either propranolol or diazepam. Concomitant administration of disopyramide phosphate and quinidine resulted in slight increases in plasma disopyramide levels and slight decreases in plasma quinidine levels. Disopyramide phosphate does not increase serum digoxin levels. Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, disopyramide should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after verapamil administration. Although potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) have not been studied clinically, in vitro studies have shown that erythromycin and oleandomycin inhibit the metabolism of disopyramide. Cases of life-threatening interactions have been reported for disopyramide when given with clarithromycin and erythromycin indicating that coadministration of disopyramide with inhibitors of cytochrome 3A4 could result in potentially fatal interaction."], "carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility": ["Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Eighteen months of disopyramide phosphate administration to rats, at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day (about 30 times the usual daily human dose of 600 mg/day, assuming a patient weight of at least 50 kg), revealed no evidence of carcinogenic potential.

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Because of its anticholinergic activity, disopyramide phosphate should not be used in patients with glaucoma, urinary retention, or benign prostatic hypertrophy (medical conditions commonly associated with the elderly) unless adequate overriding measures are taken (see Warnings: Anticholinergic Activity ). In the event of increased anticholinergic side effects, plasma levels of disopyramide should be monitored and the dose of the drug adjusted accordingly.

Some cases of LE (lupus erythematosus) symptoms have been reported; most cases occurred in patients who had been switched to disopyramide from procainamide following the development of LE symptoms. Rarely, acute psychosis has been reported following disopyramide phosphate therapy, with prompt return to normal mental status when therapy was stopped. The physician should be aware of these possible reactions and should discontinue disopyramide phosphate therapy promptly if they occur."], "overdosage": ["OVERDOSAGE Symptoms Deliberate or accidental overdosage of oral disopyramide may be followed by apnea, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrhythmias, and loss of spontaneous respiration. Death has occurred following overdosage. Toxic plasma levels of disopyramide produce excessive widening of the QRS complex and Q-T interval, worsening of congestive heart failure, hypotension, varying kinds and degrees of conduction disturbance, bradycardia, and finally asystole. Obvious anticholinergic effects are also observed. The approximate oral LD 50 of disopyramide phosphate is 580 and 700 mg/kg for rats and mice, respectively. Treatment Experience indicates that prompt and vigorous treatment of overdosage is necessary, even in the absence of symptoms. Such treatment may be life-saving. No specific antidote for disopyramide phosphate has been identified. Treatment should be symptomatic and may include induction of emesis or gastric lavage, administration of a cathartic followed by activated charcoal by mouth or stomach tube, intravenous administration of isoproterenol and dopamine, insertion of an intra-aortic balloon for counterpulsation, and mechanically assisted ventilation. Hemodialysis or, preferably, hemoperfusion with charcoal may be employed to lower serum concentration of the drug. The electrocardiogram should be monitored, and supportive therapy with cardiac glycosides and diuretics should be given as required. If progressive AV block should develop, endocardial pacing should be implemented. In case of any impaired renal function, measures to increase the glomerular filtration rate may reduce the toxicity (disopyramide is excreted primarily by the kidney). The anticholinergic effects can be reversed with neostigmine at the discretion of the physician. Altering the urinary pH in humans does not affect the plasma half-life or the amount of disopyramide excreted in the urine."], "dosage_and_administration": ["DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dosage of disopyramide phosphate must be individualized for each patient on the basis of response and tolerance. The usual adult dosage of disopyramide phosphate is 400 to 800 mg per day given in divided doses. The recommended dosage for most adults is 600 mg/day given in divided doses (150 mg every 6 hours for immediate-release disopyramide phosphate). For patients whose body weight is less than 110 pounds (50 kg), the recommended dosage is 400 mg/day given in divided doses (100 mg every 6 hours for immediate-release disopyramide phosphate). In the event of increased anticholinergic side effects, plasma levels of disopyramide should be monitored and the dose of the drug adjusted accordingly. A reduction of the dose by one third, from the recommended 600 mg/day to 400 mg/day, would be reasonable, without changing the dosing interval. For patients with cardiomyopathy or possible cardiac decompensation, a loading dose, as discussed below, should not be given, and initial dosage should be limited to 100 mg of immediate-release disopyramide phosphate every 6 to 8 hours. Subsequent dosage adjustments should be made gradually, with close monitoring for the possible development of hypotension and/or congestive heart failure (see Warnings ). For patients with moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance greater than 40 ml/min) or hepatic insufficiency, the recommended dosage is 400 mg/day given in divided doses (100 mg every 6 hours for immediate-release disopyramide phosphate). For patients with severe renal insufficiency (C cr 40 ml/min or less), the recommended dosage regimen of immediate-release disopyramide phosphate is 100 mg at intervals shown in the table below, with or without an initial loading dose of 150 mg. IMMEDIATE-RELEASE DISOPYRAMIDE PHOSPHATE DOSAGE INTERVAL FOR PATIENTS WITH RENAL INSUFFICIENCY Creatinine Clearance (ml/min) 40\u201330 30\u201315 Less than 15 Approximate Maintenance-dosing interval q 8 hr q 12 hr Q 24 hr For patients in whom rapid control of ventricular arrhythmia is essential, an initial loading dose of 300 mg of immediate-release disopyramide phosphate (200 mg for patients whose body weight is less than 110 pounds) is recommended, followed by the appropriate maintenance dosage. Therapeutic effects are usually attained 30 minutes to 3 hours after administration of a 300-mg loading dose. If there is no response or evidence of toxicity within 6 hours of the loading dose, 200 mg of immediate-release disopyramide phosphate every 6 hours may be prescribed instead of the usual 150 mg. If there is no response to this dosage within 48 hours, either disopyramide phosphate should then be discontinued or the physician should consider hospitalizing the patient for careful monitoring while subsequent immediate-release disopyramide phosphate doses of 250 mg or 300 mg every 6 hours are given. A limited number of patients with severe refractory ventricular tachycardia have tolerated daily doses of disopyramide phosphate up to 1600 mg per day (400 mg every 6 hours), resulting in disopyramide plasma levels up to 9 mcg/ml. If such treatment is warranted, it is essential that patients be hospitalized for close evaluation and continuous monitoring. Transferring to disopyramide phosphate immediate release or Norpace CR. The following dosage schedule based on theoretical considerations rather than experimental data is suggested for transferring patients with normal renal function from either quinidine sulfate or procainamide therapy (Type 1 antiarrhythmic agents) to disopyramide phosphate therapy: Disopyramide phosphate should be started using the regular maintenance schedule without a loading dose 6 to 12 hours after the last dose of quinidine sulfate or 3 to 6 hours after the last dose of procainamide. In patients in whom withdrawal of quinidine sulfate or procainamide is likely to produce life-threatening arrhythmias, the physician should consider hospitalization of the patient. When transferring a patient from immediate-release disopyramide phosphate to Norpace CR, the maintenance schedule of Norpace CR may be started 6 hours after the last dose of immediate-release disopyramide phosphate. Pediatric Dosage Controlled clinical studies have not been conducted in pediatric patients; however, the following suggested dosage table is based on published clinical experience. Total daily dosage should be divided and equal doses administered orally every 6 hours or at intervals according to individual patient needs. Disopyramide plasma levels and therapeutic response must be monitored closely. Patients should be hospitalized during the initial treatment period, and dose titration should start at the lower end of the ranges provided below.

Estradiol, silicone polymers and barium sulfate are combined to form the ring. When placed in the vagina, ESTRING releases estradiol, approximately 7.5 mcg per 24 hours, in a consistent stable manner over 90 days. ESTRING has the following dimensions: outer diameter 55 mm; cross-sectional diameter 9 mm; core diameter 2 mm. One ESTRING should be inserted into the upper third of the vaginal vault, to be worn continuously for three months. Estradiol is chemically described as estra-1, 3, 5(10)-triene-3, 17\u03b2-diol. The molecular formula of estradiol is C 18 H 24 O 2 and the structural formula is: The molecular weight of estradiol is 272.39. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Estrogens used in therapeutics are well absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The vaginal delivery of estrogens circumvents first-pass metabolism. In a Phase I study of 14 postmenopausal women, the insertion of ESTRING (estradiol vaginal ring) rapidly increased serum estradiol (E 2 ) levels. The time to attain peak serum estradiol levels (T max ) was 0.5 to 1 hour. Peak serum estradiol concentrations post-initial burst declined rapidly over the next 24 hours and were virtually indistinguishable from the baseline mean (range: 5 to 22 pg/mL). Serum levels of estradiol and estrone (E 1 ) over the following 12 weeks during which the ring was maintained in the vaginal vault remained relatively unchanged (see Table 1 ). The initial estradiol peak post-application of the second ring in the same women resulted in ~38 percent lower C max , apparently due to reduced systemic absorption via the treated vaginal epithelium. The relative systemic exposure from the initial peak of ESTRING accounted for approximately 4 percent of the total estradiol exposure over the 12-week period. The release of estradiol from ESTRING was demonstrated in a Phase II study of 222 postmenopausal women who inserted up to four rings consecutively at three-month intervals. Systemic delivery of estradiol from ESTRING resulted in mean steady state serum estradiol estimates of 7.8, 7.0, 7.0, 8.1 pg/mL at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48, respectively. Similar reproducibility is also seen in levels of estrone. The systemic exposure to estradiol and estrone was within the range observed in untreated women after the first eight hours. In postmenopausal women, mean dose of estradiol systemically absorbed unchanged from ESTRING is ~8 percent [95 percent CI: 2.8\u201312.8 percent] of the daily amount released locally.

Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. Excretion Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Special Populations No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with Estring in specific populations, including women with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions No formal drug interactions studies have been done with ESTRING. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that systemic estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John's Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in systemic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile.

In a U.S. study where ESTRING was compared with conjugated estrogens vaginal cream, no difference in efficacy between the treatment groups was found with respect to improvement in the physician's global assessment of vaginal symptoms (83 percent and 82 percent of patients receiving ESTRING and cream, respectively) and in the patient's global assessment of vaginal symptoms (83 percent and 82 percent of patients receiving ESTRING and cream, respectively) after 12 weeks of treatment. In an Australian study, ESTRING was also compared with conjugated estrogens vaginal cream and no difference in the physician's assessment of improvement of vaginal mucosal atrophy (79 percent and 75 percent for ESTRING and cream, respectively) or in the patient's assessment of improvement in vaginal dryness (82 percent and 76 percent for ESTRING and cream, respectively) after 12 weeks of treatment. In the U.S. study, symptoms of dysuria and urinary urgency improved in 74 percent and 65 percent, respectively, of patients receiving ESTRING as assessed by the patient. In the Australian study, symptoms of dysuria and urinary urgency improved in 90 percent and 71 percent, respectively, of patients receiving ESTRING as assessed by the patient. In both studies, ESTRING and conjugated estrogens vaginal cream had a similar ability to reduce vaginal pH levels and to mature the vaginal mucosa (as measured cytologically using the maturation index and/or the maturation value) after 12 weeks of treatment. In supportive studies, ESTRING was also shown to have a similar significant treatment effect on the maturation of the urethral mucosa. Endometrial overstimulation, as evaluated in non-hysterectomized patients participating in the U.S. study by the progestogen challenge test and pelvic sonogram, was reported for none of the 58 (0 percent) patients receiving ESTRING and 4 of the 35 patients (11 percent) receiving conjugated estrogens vaginal cream. Of the U.S. women who completed 12 weeks of treatment, 95 percent rated product comfort for ESTRING as excellent or very good compared with 65 percent of patients receiving conjugated estrogens vaginal cream, 95 percent of ESTRING patients judged the product to be very easy or easy to use compared with 88 percent of cream patients, and 82 percent gave ESTRING an overall rating of excellent or very good compared with 58 percent for the cream. Women's Health Initiative Studies The WHI enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral CE (0.625 mg)-alone or in combination with MPA (2.5 mg) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \"global index\" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen-Alone Substudy The WHI estrogen-alone substudy was stopped early because an increased risk of stroke was observed, and it was deemed that no further information would be obtained regarding the risks and benefits of estrogen-alone in predetermined primary endpoints. Results of the estrogen-alone substudy, which included 10,739 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 75.3 percent White, 15.1 percent Black, 6.1 percent Hispanic, 3.6 percent Other), after an average follow-up of 7.1 years are presented in Table 2.

The absolute excess risk of events included in the \"global index\" was a non-significant 5 events per 10,000 women-years. There was no difference between the groups in terms of all-cause mortality. No overall difference for primary CHD events (nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death) and invasive breast cancer incidence in women receiving CE-alone compared with placebo was reported in final centrally adjudicated results from the estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years. Centrally adjudicated results for stroke events from the estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, reported no significant differences in distribution of stroke subtypes or severity, including fatal strokes, in women receiving CE-alone compared to placebo. Estrogen alone increased the risk for ischemic stroke, and this excess risk was present in all subgroups of women examined (see Table 2 ). Timing of initiation of estrogen-alone therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen-alone substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a non-significant trend toward reduced risk for CHD [hazard ratio (HR) 0.63 (95 percent CI, 0.36\u20131.09)] and overall mortality [HR 0.71 (95 percent CI, 0.46\u20131.11)] . WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was also stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \"global index.\" The absolute excess risk of events included in the \"global index\" was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \"global index\" that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reductions per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other), are presented in Table 3.

Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2,947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 69 years of age (45 percent were 65 to 69 years of age, 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 19 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83\u20132.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in the study included Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See BOXED WARNINGS , WARNINGS, Probable Dementia , and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .) The WHIMS ancillary study enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21\u20133.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in the study included AD, VaD and mixed types (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD.

(See WARNINGS, Probable Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use . ) When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19\u20132.60). Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

However, the warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions associated with oral estrogen and/or progestin therapy should be considered in the absence of comparable data with other dosage forms of estrogens and/or progestins. 1. Cardiovascular Disorders An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. An increased risk of stroke, DVT, PE, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogens with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year one and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years). In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on CHD events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE [0.625 mg]-alone compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years). In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the combined continuous CE plus MPA treatment group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE) was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women receiving placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately. In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was observed during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12-times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15 to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. b. Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.80. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .)Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline in about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast exams by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77\u20133.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies. The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27\u20131.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the CE-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83\u20132.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .) In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE/MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21\u20133.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE/MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .) When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19\u20132.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .) 4. Gallbladder Disease A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported. 5. Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level. 6. Visual abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be discontinued. 7. Hereditary Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema."], "precautions": ["PRECAUTIONS A. General 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen alone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Elevated blood pressure In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. 3. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 4. Hepatic impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 5. Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T 4 and T 3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 6. Hypocalcemia Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 7. Fluid retention Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen-alone is prescribed. 8. Exacerbation of endometriosis A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered. 9. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. 10. Location of ESTRING Some women have experienced moving or gliding of ESTRING within the vagina. Instances of ESTRING being expelled from the vagina in connection with moving the bowels, strain, or constipation have been reported. If this occurs, ESTRING can be rinsed in lukewarm water and reinserted into the vagina by the patient. 11. Vaginal Irritation ESTRING may not be suitable for women with narrow, short, or stenosed vaginas. Narrow vagina, vaginal stenosis, prolapse, and vaginal infections are conditions that make the vagina more susceptible to ESTRING-caused irritation or ulceration. Women with signs or symptoms of vaginal irritation should alert their physician. 12. Vaginal Infection Vaginal infection is generally more common in postmenopausal women due to the lack of the normal flora of fertile women, especially lactobacillus, and the subsequent higher pH. Vaginal infections should be treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy before initiation of ESTRING. If a vaginal infection develops during use of ESTRING, then ESTRING should be removed and reinserted only after the infection has been appropriately treated. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the PATIENT INFORMATION leaflet with women for whom they prescribe ESTRING. C. Laboratory Tests Serum FSH and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. D. Drug and Laboratory Test Interactions 1. Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. 2. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T 4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T 3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T 3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T 4 and free T 3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. 3. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, (i.e., corticosteroid binding globulin [CBG], sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG]), leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). 4. Increased plasma high-density (HDL) and HDL 2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. 5. Impaired glucose tolerance. E. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Long-term, continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testes and liver. F. Pregnancy ESTRING should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who have used estrogens and progestins as an oral contraceptive inadvertently during early pregnancy. G. Nursing Mothers ESTRING should not be used during lactation. Estrogen administration to nursing women has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the breast milk. Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the breast milk of mothers receiving estrogens. Caution should be exercised when ESTRING is administered to a nursing woman. H. Pediatric Use ESTRING is not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. I. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients involved in studies utilizing ESTRING to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to ESTRING. The Women's Health Initiative Study In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg]-alone versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of stroke in women greater than 65 years of age. ( See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age.

The ring is to remain in place continuously for three months, after which it is to be removed and, if appropriate, replaced by a new ring. The need to continue treatment should be assessed at 3 or 6 month intervals. Should the ring be removed or fall out at any time during the 90-day treatment period, the ring should be rinsed in lukewarm water and re-inserted by the patient, or, if necessary, by a physician or nurse. Retention of the ring for greater than 90 days does not represent overdosage but will result in progressively greater underdosage with the attendant risk of loss of efficacy and increasing risk of vaginal infections and/or erosions. Instructions for Use ESTRING (estradiol vaginal ring) insertion The ring should be pressed into an oval and inserted into the upper third of the vaginal vault. The exact position is not critical. When ESTRING is in place, the patient should not feel anything. If the patient feels discomfort, ESTRING is probably not far enough inside. Gently push ESTRING further into the vagina. ESTRING use ESTRING should be left in place continuously for 90 days and then, if continuation of therapy is deemed appropriate, replaced by a new ESTRING. The patient should not feel ESTRING when it is in place and it should not interfere with sexual intercourse. Straining at defecation may make ESTRING move down in the lower part of the vagina. If so, it may be pushed up again with a finger. If ESTRING is expelled totally from the vagina, it should be rinsed in lukewarm water and reinserted by the patient (or doctor/nurse if necessary).

Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away while you are using ESTRING. Vaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterine (womb). Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause. \u2022 Do not use estrogen-alone to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). \u2022 Using estrogen-alone may increase your chances of getting strokes or blood clots. \u2022 Using estrogen-alone may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women 65 years of age or older. \u2022 Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia. \u2022 Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, or blood clots. \u2022 Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women 65 years of age or older. \u2022 You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with ESTRING. What is ESTRING? ESTRING (estradiol vaginal ring) is an off-white, soft, flexible ring with a center that contains 2 mg of estradiol (an estrogen hormone). ESTRING releases estradiol into the vagina in a consistent, stable manner for 90 days. The soft, flexible ring is placed in the upper third of the vagina (by the physician or the patient). ESTRING should be removed after 90 days of continuous use. If continuation of therapy is indicated, the flexible ring should be replaced. What is ESTRING used for? ESTRING is used after menopause to treat moderate to severe menopausal changes in and around the vagina. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with ESTRING to control these problems. Who should not use ESTRING? Do not start using ESTRING if you: \u2022 have unusual vaginal bleeding Vaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus (womb). Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause. \u2022 currently have or have had certain cancers Estrogens may increase the chance of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus. If you have or had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should use ESTRING. \u2022 had a stroke or heart attack \u2022 currently have or have had blood clots \u2022 currently have or have had liver problems \u2022 have been diagnosed with a bleeding disorder \u2022 are allergic to ESTRING or any of its ingredients See the list of ingredients in ESTRING at the end of this leaflet. \u2022 think you may be pregnant ESTRING is not for pregnant women. If you think you may be pregnant, you should have a pregnancy test and know the results. Do not use ESTRING if the test is positive and talk to your healthcare provider. What should I tell my healthcare provider before I use ESTRING? Before you use ESTRING, tell your healthcare provider if you: \u2022 have any unusual vaginal bleeding Vaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sigh of cancer of the uterus (womb). Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause. \u2022 have any other medical conditions Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions, such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), diabetes, migraine, endometriosis, lupus, angioedema (swelling of face and tongue), or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium levels in your blood. \u2022 are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest Your healthcare provider will let you know if you need to stop using ESTRING. \u2022 are breast feeding The hormone in ESTRING can pass into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how ESTRING works. ESTRING may also affect how your other medicines work. What are the possible side effects of ESTRING? If you experience any of the following side-effects, immediately remove ESTRING if possible and contact your healthcare provider. If you experience difficulty or pain when trying to remove the ring please do not continue and contact your healthcare provider: \u2022 Cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) have been reported in women using vaginal rings. Toxic shock syndrome is a rare but serious illness caused by a bacterial infection. Symptoms of TSS include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, dizziness, faintness, or a sunburn-like rash on face and body. \u2022 Cases of the vaginal ring becoming attached to the vaginal wall, making ring removal difficult, have occurred. Some women have needed surgery to remove vaginal rings \u2022 Cases of erosion (wearing away) and ulceration (holes) of the vaginal lining have also occurred. Symptoms of vaginal erosion and ulceration can include vaginal pain or soreness, vaginal bleeding, and redness, swelling, or scrapes in the vagina. \u2022 Cases of bowel obstruction have been reported. \u2022 Severe allergic reactions have been reported including skin rash, giant hives, swelling of the eyelids, face, lips, tongue or throat. The most frequently reported side effect with ESTRING use is increased vaginal secretions. Many of these vaginal secretions are like those that occur normally prior to menopause and indicate that ESTRING is working. Vaginal secretions that are associated with a bad odor, vaginal itching, or other signs of vaginal infection are NOT normal and may indicate a risk or a cause for concern. Other side effects may include vaginal discomfort, abdominal pain, or genital itching. What are the possible side effects of estrogens? Side effects are grouped by how serious they are and how often they happen when you are treated. Serious, but less common side effects include: \u2022 heart attack \u2022 stroke \u2022 blood clots \u2022 dementia \u2022 breast cancer \u2022 cancer of the lining of the uterus (womb) \u2022 cancer of the ovary \u2022 high blood pressure \u2022 high blood sugar \u2022 gallbladder disease \u2022 liver problems \u2022 changes in your thyroid hormone levels \u2022 enlargement of benign tumors of the uterus (\"fibroids\") Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following warning signs or any other unusual symptoms that concern you: \u2022 new breast lumps \u2022 unusual vaginal bleeding \u2022 changes in vision or speech \u2022 sudden new severe headaches \u2022 severe pains in your chest or legs with or without shortness of breath, weakness and fatigue \u2022 memory loss or confusion Less serious, but common side effects include: \u2022 headache \u2022 breast pain \u2022 irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting \u2022 stomach or abdominal cramps, bloating \u2022 nausea and vomiting \u2022 fluid retention \u2022 vaginal yeast infection These are not all the possible side effects of ESTRING. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice about side effects. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may report side effects to Pfizer at 1-800-438-1985. What can I do to lower my chances of getting a serious side effect with ESTRING? \u2022 Follow carefully the instructions for use. \u2022 Talk with your healthcare provider regularly about whether you should continue using ESTRING. \u2022 See your healthcare provider right away if you get vaginal bleeding while using ESTRING. \u2022 If you have fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, dizziness, faintness, or a sunburn-like rash on face and body, remove ESTRING and contact your healthcare provider. \u2022 Contact your healthcare provider if you have difficulty removing the vaginal ring. \u2022 Have a breast exam and mammogram (breast X-ray) every year unless your healthcare provider tells you something else. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast examinations more often. \u2022 If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are overweight, or if you use tobacco, you may have higher chances for getting heart disease. Ask your healthcare provider for ways to lower your chances for getting heart disease. General information about safe and effective use of ESTRING Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use ESTRING for conditions for which it was not prescribed. Do not give ESTRING to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. Keep ESTRING out of the reach of children. This leaflet provides a summary of the most important information about ESTRING. If you would like more information, talk with your healthcare provider or pharmacist. You can ask for information about ESTRING that is written for health professionals. You can get more information by calling the toll free number 1-888-691-6813. What are the ingredients in ESTRING? ESTRING (estradiol vaginal ring) is a slightly opaque ring with a whitish core containing a drug reservoir of 2 mg estradiol (an estrogen hormone). Estradiol, silicone polymers and barium sulfate are combined to form the ring. Storage: Store at controlled room temperature 15\u00b0 to 25 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F to 77 \u00b0F)."], "instructions_for_use": ["INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE How should I use ESTRING? ESTRING is a local estrogen therapy used after menopause to treat moderate to severe menopausal changes in and around the vagina. ESTRING PROVIDES RELIEF OF LOCAL SYMPTOMS OF MENOPAUSE ONLY. Estrogens should be used only as long as needed. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (for example, every 3 to 6 months) about whether you still need treatment with ESTRING. ESTRING INSERTION ESTRING can be inserted and removed by you or your doctor or healthcare provider. To insert ESTRING yourself, choose the position that is most comfortable for you: standing with one leg up, squatting, or lying down. 1. After washing and drying your hands, remove ESTRING from its pouch using the tear-off notch on the side. (Since the ring becomes slippery when wet, be sure your hands are dry before handling it.) 2. Hold ESTRING between your thumb and index finger and press the opposite sides of the ring together as shown. 3. Gently push the compressed ring into your vagina as far as you can. ESTRING PLACEMENT The exact position of ESTRING is not critical, as long as it is placed in the upper third of the vagina. When ESTRING is in place, you should not feel anything. If you feel uncomfortable, ESTRING is probably not far enough inside. Use your finger to gently push ESTRING further into your vagina. There is no danger of ESTRING being pushed too far up in the vagina or getting lost. ESTRING can only be inserted as far as the end of the vagina, where the cervix (the narrow, lower end of the uterus) will block ESTRING from going any further (see diagram of Female Anatomy ). ESTRING USE Once inserted, ESTRING should remain in place in the vagina for 90 days. Most women and their partners experience no discomfort with ESTRING in place during intercourse, so it is NOT necessary that the ring be removed. If ESTRING should cause you or your partner any discomfort, you may remove it prior to intercourse (see ESTRING Removal , below). Be sure to reinsert ESTRING as soon as possible afterwards. ESTRING may slide down into the lower part of the vagina as a result of the abdominal pressure or straining that sometimes accompanies constipation. If this should happen, gently guide ESTRING back into place with your finger. There have been rare reports of ESTRING falling out in some women following intense straining or coughing. If this should occur, simply wash ESTRING with lukewarm (NOT hot) water and reinsert it. ESTRING DRUG DELIVERY Once in the vagina, ESTRING begins to release estradiol immediately. ESTRING will continue to release a low, continuous dose of estradiol for the full 90 days it remains in place. It will take about 2 to 3 weeks to restore the tissue of the vagina and urinary tract to a healthier condition and to feel the full effect of ESTRING in relieving vaginal and urinary symptoms. If your symptoms persist for more than a few weeks after beginning ESTRING therapy, contact your doctor or healthcare provider. One of the most frequently reported effects associated with the use of ESTRING is an increase in vaginal secretions. These secretions are like those that occur normally prior to menopause and indicate that ESTRING is working. However, if the secretions are associated with a bad odor or vaginal itching or discomfort, be sure to contact your doctor or healthcare provider. ESTRING REMOVAL After 90 days there will no longer be enough estradiol in the ring to maintain its full effect in relieving your vaginal or urinary symptoms. ESTRING should be removed at that time and replaced with a new ESTRING, if your doctor determines that you need to continue your therapy. To remove ESTRING: 1. Wash and dry your hands thoroughly. 2. Assume a comfortable position, either standing with one leg up, squatting, or lying down. 3. Loop your finger through the ring and gently pull it out. 4. Discard the used ring in a waste receptacle. (Do not flush ESTRING.) If you have any additional questions about removing ESTRING, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.

Discontinue TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop, as a delay in stopping treatment may result in a life-threatening reaction. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving dolutegravir-containing regimens. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Embryo-fetal toxicity may occur when used at the time of conception and in early pregnancy. Assess the risks and benefits of TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD and discuss with the patient to determine if an alternative treatment should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester due to the risk of neural tube defects. Adolescents and adults of childbearing potential should be counseled on the consistent use of effective contraception. ( 2.1 , 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) \u2022 Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 TIVICAY tablets and TIVICAY PD tablets for oral suspension are not interchangeable. ( 2.3 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury. The events were reported in less than 1% of subjects receiving TIVICAY in Phase 3 clinical trials. Discontinue TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters or peeling of the skin, oral blisters or lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema, difficulty breathing). Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping treatment with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD or other suspect agents after the onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening reaction. TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD are contraindicated in patients who have experienced a previous hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir-containing regimen. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In some cases, the elevations in transaminases were consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or hepatitis B reactivation particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn. Cases of hepatic toxicity, including elevated serum liver biochemistries, hepatitis, and acute liver failure have been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir-containing regimen without pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Drug-induced liver injury leading to liver transplant has been reported with TRIUMEQ (abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine). Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity An ongoing observational study showed an association between dolutegravir and an increased risk of neural tube defects when dolutegravir was administered at the time of conception and in early pregnancy. As there is limited understanding of the association of reported types of neural tube defects with dolutegravir use, inform adolescents and adults of childbearing potential, including those actively trying to become pregnant, about the potential increased risk of neural tube defects with TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD. Assess the risks and benefits of TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD and discuss with the patient to determine if an alternative treatment should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . Pregnancy testing is recommended before initiation of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD in adolescents and adults of childbearing potential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Adolescents and adults of childbearing potential should be counseled on the consistent use of effective contraception [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD may be considered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the pregnant woman and the fetus. 5.4 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] : \u2022 Loss of therapeutic effect of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD and possible development of resistance. \u2022 Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. For concomitant drugs for which the interaction can be mitigated, please see Table 8 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD; review concomitant medications during therapy with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Different Formulations Are Not Interchangeable TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD are not bioequivalent and are not interchangeable on a milligram-per-milligram basis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . If a pediatric patient switches from one formulation to the other, the dose must be adjusted for the new dosage formulation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Incorrect dosing of a given formulation may result in underdosing and loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance or possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposure of dolutegravir."], "adverse_reactions": ["6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse drug reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. \u2022 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . The most common adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity and incidence at least 2% (in those receiving TIVICAY in any one adult trial) are insomnia, fatigue, and headache.

Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects Treatment-Na\u00efve Subjects: The safety assessment of TIVICAY in HIV\u20111\u2013infected treatment-na\u00efve subjects is based on the analyses of data from 2 international, multicenter, double-blind trials, SPRING-2 (ING113086) and SINGLE (ING114467) and data from the international, multicenter, open-label FLAMINGO (ING114915) trial. In SPRING-2, 822 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either TIVICAY 50 mg once daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, both in combination with fixed-dose dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment (either abacavir sulfate and lamivudine [EPZICOM] or emtricitabine/tenofovir [TRUVADA]). There were 808 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. Through 96 weeks, the rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation was 2% in both treatment arms. In SINGLE, 833 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either TIVICAY 50 mg with fixed-dose abacavir sulfate and lamivudine (EPZICOM) once daily or fixed-dose efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (ATRIPLA) once daily (study treatment was blinded through Week 96 and open-label from Week 96 through Week 144). Through 144 weeks, the rates of adverse events leading to discontinuation were 4% in subjects receiving TIVICAY 50 mg once daily + EPZICOM and 14% in subjects receiving ATRIPLA once daily. Treatment\u2011emergent adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity observed in at least 2% of subjects in either treatment arm in SPRING-2 and SINGLE trials are provided in Table 5 . Side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs. Table 5.

These events were not treatment limiting. In a multicenter, open-label trial (FLAMINGO), 243 subjects received TIVICAY 50 mg once daily versus 242 subjects who received darunavir 800 mg/ritonavir 100 mg once daily, both in combination with investigator-selected NRTI background regimen (either EPZICOM or TRUVADA). There were 484 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. Through 96 weeks, the rates of adverse events leading to discontinuation were 3% in subjects receiving TIVICAY and 6% in subjects receiving darunavir/ritonavir. The adverse reactions observed in FLAMINGO were generally consistent with those seen in SPRING-2 and SINGLE. Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Na\u00efve Subjects: In an international, multicenter, double-blind trial (ING111762, SAILING), 719 HIV\u20111\u2013infected, antiretroviral treatment-experienced adults were randomized and received either TIVICAY 50 mg once daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily with investigator-selected background regimen consisting of up to 2 agents, including at least one fully active agent. At 48 weeks, the rates of adverse events leading to discontinuation were 3% in subjects receiving TIVICAY 50 mg once daily + background regimen and 4% in subjects receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily + background regimen. The only treatment\u2011emergent adverse reaction of moderate to severe intensity with at least 2% frequency in either treatment group was diarrhea, 2% (6 of 354) in subjects receiving TIVICAY 50 mg once daily + background regimen and 1% (5 of 361) in subjects receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily + background regimen. Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Experienced Subjects: In a multicenter, open-label, single\u2011arm trial (ING112574, VIKING-3), 183 HIV\u20111\u2013infected, antiretroviral treatment-experienced adults with virological failure and current or historical evidence of raltegravir and/or elvitegravir resistance received TIVICAY 50 mg twice daily with the current failing background regimen for 7 days and with optimized background therapy from Day 8. The rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation was 4% of subjects at Week 48. Treatment\u2011emergent adverse reactions in VIKING-3 were generally similar compared with observations with the 50-mg once-daily dose in adult Phase 3 trials. Virologically Suppressed Subjects: The adverse reactions observed for TIVICAY plus rilpivirine in the Week 48 analysis of pooled data from 2 identical, international, multicenter, open-label trials (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2) of 513 HIV-1\u2013infected, virologically suppressed subjects switching from their current antiretroviral regimen to TIVICAY plus rilpivirine, were consistent with the adverse reaction profiles and severities for the individual components when administered with other antiretroviral agents. There were no adverse reactions (Grades 2 to 4) with an incidence of at least 2% in either treatment arm at Week 48. The safety profile during the additional follow-up period through Week 148 were consistent with Week 48. The rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation through Week 48 was 4% in subjects receiving TIVICAY plus rilpivirine once daily and less than 1% in subjects who remained on their current antiretroviral regimen. In the pooled analyses, the proportion of subjects receiving TIVICAY plus rilpivirine who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event through Week 148 was 8%. Less Common Adverse Reactions Observed in Treatment-Na\u00efve and Treatment-Experienced Trials: The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 2% of treatment-na\u00efve or treatment-experienced subjects receiving TIVICAY in a combination regimen in any one trial. These events have been included because of their seriousness and assessment of potential causal relationship. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, flatulence, upper abdominal pain, vomiting. Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis. Musculoskeletal Disorders: Myositis. Psychiatric Disorders: Suicidal ideation, attempt, behavior, or completion. These events were observed primarily in subjects with a pre-existing history of depression or other psychiatric illness. Renal and Urinary Disorders: Renal impairment. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Pruritus. Laboratory Abnormalities: Treatment-Na\u00efve Subjects: Selected laboratory abnormalities (Grades 2 to 4) with a worsening grade from baseline and representing the worst-grade toxicity in at least 2% of subjects are presented in Table 6 . The mean change from baseline observed for selected lipid values is presented in Table 7 . Side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs. Table 6.

Mean Change from Baseline in Fasted Lipid Values in Treatment-Na\u00efve Subjects in SPRING-2 (Week 96 Analysisa) and SINGLE Trials (Week 144 Analysis a ) HDL = High density lipoprotein; LDL = Low density lipoprotein. a Subjects on lipid-lowering agents at baseline were excluded from these analyses (19 subjects in each arm in SPRING-2, and in SINGLE: TIVICAY + EPZICOM n = 30 and ATRIPLA n = 27). Ninety-four subjects initiated a lipid-lowering agent post-baseline; their last fasted on-treatment values (prior to starting the agent) were used regardless of whether they discontinued the agent (SPRING-2: TIVICAY n = 9, raltegravir n = 13; SINGLE: TIVICAY + EPZICOM n = 36, ATRIPLA n = 36). Laboratory Parameter Preferred Term SPRING-2 SINGLE TIVICAY 50 mg Once Daily + 2 NRTIs (n = 403) Raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily + 2 NRTIs (n = 405) TIVICAY 50 mg + EPZICOM Once Daily (n = 414) ATRIPLA Once Daily (n = 419) Cholesterol (mg/dL) 8.1 10.1 24.0 26.7 HDL cholesterol (mg/dL) 2.0 2.3 5.4 7.2 LDL cholesterol (mg/dL) 5.1 6.1 16.0 14.6 Triglycerides (mg/dL) 6.7 6.6 13.6 31.9 Laboratory abnormalities observed in the FLAMINGO trial were generally consistent with observations in SPRING-2 and SINGLE. Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Na\u00efve Subjects: Laboratory abnormalities observed in SAILING were generally similar compared with observations seen in the treatment-na\u00efve (SPRING-2 and SINGLE) trials. Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Experienced Subjects: The most common treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities (greater than 5% for Grades 2 to 4 combined) observed in VIKING-3 at Week 48 were elevated ALT (9%), AST (8%), cholesterol (10%), creatine kinase (6%), hyperglycemia (14%), and lipase (10%). Two percent (4 of 183) of subjects had a Grade 3 to 4 treatment-emergent hematology laboratory abnormality, with neutropenia (2% [3 of 183]) being the most frequently reported. Virologically Suppressed Adults: Laboratory abnormalities observed in SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 were generally similar compared with observations seen in the other Phase 3 trials. Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus Co-infection: In Phase 3 trials, subjects with hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection were permitted to enroll provided that baseline liver chemistry tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal. Overall, the safety profile in subjects with hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection was similar to that observed in subjects without hepatitis B or C co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection for all treatment groups. Grades 2 to 4 ALT abnormalities in hepatitis B and/or C co-infected compared with HIV mono-infected subjects receiving TIVICAY were observed in 18% vs. 3% with the 50-mg once-daily dose and 13% vs. 8% with the 50-mg twice-daily dose. Liver chemistry elevations consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome were observed in some subjects with hepatitis B and/or C at the start of therapy with TIVICAY, particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Changes in Serum Creatinine: Dolutegravir has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Increases in serum creatinine occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment and remained stable through 96 weeks. In treatment-na\u00efve subjects, a mean change from baseline of 0.15 mg per dL (range: -0.32 mg per dL to 0.65 mg per dL) was observed after 96 weeks of treatment. Creatinine increases were comparable by background NRTIs and were similar in treatment-experienced subjects. Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects The safety and pharmacokinetics of TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD in HIV-1\u2013infected pediatric subjects aged at least 4 weeks and weighing at least 3 kg was evaluated in the IMPAACT P1093 trial and 2 weight-band-based pharmacokinetic substudies of the ODYSSEY trial [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Overall, the safety data in these pediatric studies were similar to those seen in adults, and there was no clinically significant difference in dolutegravir exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . IMPAACT P1093 is an ongoing, multicenter, open-label, non-comparative trial of HIV\u20111\u2013infected pediatric subjects aged 4 weeks to less than 18 years [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . The safety analysis based on subjects (n = 75) who received the recommended dose (determined by weight and age) through Week 24 showed that 11% of subjects experienced drug-related clinical adverse reactions. The only Grade 1 to 2 drug-related clinical adverse reactions reported by more than one subject was immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (n = 2). There were no Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse reactions reported. No adverse reactions led to discontinuation. The Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities reported in more than one subject were decreased neutrophil count (n = 11), decreased blood bicarbonate (n = 4), decreased hemoglobin (n = 3), increased lipase (n = 2), and increased blood potassium (n = 2). These laboratory events were not considered to be drug-related. Median laboratory values were similar at baseline and Week 24. Changes in median serum creatinine were similar to those observed in adults. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

( 4 , 7 ) \u2022 Drugs that are metabolic inducers may decrease the plasma concentrations of dolutegravir. ( 7.2 , 7.3 ) \u2022 TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD should be taken 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking cation-containing antacids or laxatives, sucralfate, oral supplements containing iron or calcium, or buffered medications. When taken with food, TIVICAY and supplements containing calcium or iron can be taken at the same time. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Effect of Dolutegravir on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents In vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the renal organic cation transporters, OCT2 (IC 50 = 1.93 microM) and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE) 1 (IC 50 = 6.34 microM). In vivo, dolutegravir inhibits tubular secretion of creatinine by inhibiting OCT2 and potentially MATE1. Dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrations of drugs eliminated via OCT2 or MATE1 (dofetilide, dalfampridine, and metformin, Table 8 ) [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . In vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the basolateral renal transporters, organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 (IC 50 = 2.12 microM) and OAT3 (IC 50 = 1.97 microM). However, in vivo, dolutegravir did not alter the plasma concentrations of tenofovir or para-amino hippurate, substrates of OAT1 and OAT3. In vitro, dolutegravir did not inhibit (IC 50 greater than 50 microM) the following: cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A, uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1, UGT2B7, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), bile salt export pump (BSEP), organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, multidrug resistance protein (MRP)2, or MRP4. In vitro, dolutegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. Based on these data and the results of drug interaction trials, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of these enzymes or transporters. 7.2 Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Dolutegravir Dolutegravir is metabolized by UGT1A1 with some contribution from CYP3A. Dolutegravir is also a substrate of UGT1A3, UGT1A9, BCRP, and P-gp in vitro. Drugs that induce those enzymes and transporters may decrease dolutegravir plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir. Coadministration of dolutegravir and other drugs that inhibit these enzymes may increase dolutegravir plasma concentration. Etravirine significantly reduced plasma concentrations of dolutegravir, but the effect of etravirine was mitigated by coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir and is expected to be mitigated by atazanavir/ritonavir ( Table 8 ) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In vitro, dolutegravir was not a substrate of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 8 provides clinical recommendations as a result of drug interactions with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction trials or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].

Risk Summary Data from an ongoing birth outcome surveillance study has identified an increased risk of neural tube defects when dolutegravir is administered at the time of conception. As defects related to closure of the neural tube occur from conception through the first 6 weeks of gestation, embryos exposed to dolutegravir from the time of conception through the first 6 weeks of gestation are at potential risk. Advise adolescents and adults of childbearing potential, including those actively trying to become pregnant, of the potential risk of neural tube defects with use of TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD. Assess the risks and benefits of TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD and discuss with the patient to determine if an alternative treatment should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester. A benefit-risk assessment should consider factors such as feasibility of switching to another antiretroviral regimen, tolerability, ability to maintain viral suppression, and risk of HIV-1 transmission to the infant against the risk of neural tube defects associated with in utero dolutegravir exposure during critical periods of fetal development [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . There are insufficient human data on the use of dolutegravir during pregnancy to definitively assess a drug-associated risk for birth defects and miscarriage. The background risk for major birth defects for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with dolutegravir at systemic exposures (AUC) less than (rabbits) and approximately 27 times (rats) the exposure in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of TIVICAY (see Data) . Data Human Data: In a birth outcome surveillance study in Botswana, there were 7 cases of neural tube defects reported out of 3,591 deliveries (0.19%) to women who were exposed to dolutegravir-containing regimens at the time of conception. In comparison, the neural tube defect prevalence rates were 0.11% (21/19,361 deliveries) in the non-dolutegravir arm and 0.07% (87/119,630 deliveries) in the HIV-uninfected arm. Seven cases reported with dolutegravir included 3 cases of myelomeningocele, 2 cases of encephalocele, and one case each of anencephaly and iniencephaly. In the same study, no increased risk of neural tube defects was identified in women who started dolutegravir during pregnancy. Two infants out of 4,448 (0.04%) deliveries to women who started dolutegravir during pregnancy had a neural tube defect, compared with 5 infants out of 6,748 (0.07%) deliveries to women who started non-dolutegravir-containing regimens during pregnancy. The reported risks of neural tube defects by treatment groups were based on interim analyses from the ongoing surveillance study in Botswana. It is unknown if baseline characteristics were balanced between the study treatment groups. The observed trends of association could change as data accumulate. Data analyzed to date from other sources including the APR, clinical trials, and postmarketing data are insufficient to definitively address the risk of neural tube defects with dolutegravir. Data from the birth outcome surveillance study described above and postmarketing sources with more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes from second and third trimester exposure in pregnant women indicate no evidence of increased risk of adverse birth outcomes. Based on prospective reports to the APR of 842 exposures to dolutegravir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including 512 exposed in the first trimester), the prevalence of defects in live births was 3.3% (95% CI: 1.9% to 5.3%) following first-trimester exposure to dolutegravir-containing regimens and 4.8% (95% CI: 2.8% to 7.8%) following second-/third-trimester exposure to dolutegravir-containing regimens. In the U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP), the background birth defect rate was 2.7%. Dolutegravir has been shown to cross the placenta. In a clinical trial in Uganda and South Africa in women during the last trimester of pregnancy receiving dolutegravir 50 mg once daily, the ratio of median dolutegravir concentration in fetal umbilical cord to that in maternal peripheral plasma was 1.21 (range 0.51-2.11) (n = 15). Animal Data: Dolutegravir was administered orally at up to 1,000 mg per kg daily to pregnant rats and rabbits on Gestation Days 6 to 17 and 6 to 18, respectively, and to rats on Gestation Day 6 to Lactation/Postpartum Day 20. No adverse effects on embryo-fetal (rats and rabbits) or pre/postnatal (rats) development were observed at up to the highest dose tested. During organogenesis, systemic exposures (AUC) to dolutegravir in rabbits were less than the exposure in humans at the MRHD and in rats were approximately 27 times the exposure in humans at the MRHD. In the rat pre/postnatal development study, decreased body weight of the developing offspring was observed during lactation at a maternally toxic dose (approximately 27 times human exposure at the MRHD). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV\u20111\u2013infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Dolutegravir is present in human milk. It is not known whether dolutegravir affects human milk production or has effects on the breastfed infant. Because of the potential for (1) HIV\u20111 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving dolutegravir. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential In adolescents and adults of childbearing potential currently on TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD who are actively trying to become pregnant or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester, assess the risks and benefits of continuing TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD and discuss with the patient if an alternative treatment should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended in adolescents and adults of childbearing potential before initiation of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Contraception Adolescents and adults of childbearing potential who are taking TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD should be counseled on the consistent use of effective contraception. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety, pharmacokinetics, and effectiveness of TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD were evaluated in 75 HIV-1\u2013infected, treatment-na\u00efve or treatment-experienced, INSTI-na\u00efve pediatric and adolescent subjects aged 4 weeks to less than 18 years weighing at least 3 kg in an ongoing, open-label, multicenter, dose-finding clinical trial, IMPAACT P1093 [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . Additional pharmacokinetics data were evaluated in 2 pharmacokinetic substudies in ODYSSEY, an ongoing open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic parameters of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD plus two NRTIs compared with standard of care in HIV-1\u2013infected pediatric subjects younger than 18 years [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Overall, the safety data in pediatric subjects from the IMPAACT P1093 trial were comparable to those observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The pharmacokinetic parameters of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD in pediatric subjects from IMPAACT P1093 and ODYSSEY were comparable to those of adults receiving 50 mg once daily or twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The effectiveness observed in IMPAACT P1093 is comparable to that of treatment-experienced adult subjects. Safety and effectiveness of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD have not been established in pediatric patients aged less than 4 weeks or weighing less than 3 kg or in any pediatric patients who are INSTI-experienced with documented or clinically suspected resistance to other INSTIs (e.g., raltegravir, elvitegravir). 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of TIVICAY did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of TIVICAY in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and matching healthy subjects were observed. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score A or B). The effect of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C) on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir has not been studied. Therefore, TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Dolutegravir plasma concentrations were decreased in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with those in matched healthy controls. However, no dosage adjustment is necessary for treatment-na\u00efve or treatment-experienced and INSTI-na\u00efve patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment or for INSTI-experienced patients (with certain INSTI-associated resistance substitutions or clinically suspected INSTI resistance) with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is warranted for INSTI-experienced patients (with certain INSTI-associated resistance substitutions or clinically suspected INSTI resistance [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )] ) with severe renal impairment, as the decrease in dolutegravir concentrations may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance to TIVICAY, TIVICAY PD, or other coadministered antiretroviral agents [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There is inadequate information to recommend appropriate dosing of dolutegravir in patients requiring dialysis."], "pregnancy": ["8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD during pregnancy.

If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored, and standard supportive treatment applied as required. As dolutegravir is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by dialysis."], "description": ["11 DESCRIPTION TIVICAY contains dolutegravir, as dolutegravir sodium, an HIV INSTI. The chemical name of dolutegravir sodium is sodium (4 R ,12a S )-9-{[(2,4-difluorophenyl)methyl]carbamoyl}-4-methyl-6,8-dioxo-3,4,6,8,12,12a-hexahydro-2 H -pyrido[1',2':4,5]pyrazino[2,1- b ][1,3]oxazin-7-olate. The empirical formula is C 20 H 18 F 2 N 3 NaO 5 and the molecular weight is 441.36 g per mol. It has the following structural formula: Dolutegravir sodium is a white to light yellow powder and is slightly soluble in water. Each film-coated tablet of TIVICAY for oral administration contains 10.5, 26.3, or 52.6 mg of dolutegravir sodium, which is equivalent to 10, 25, or 50 mg dolutegravir free acid, respectively, and the following inactive ingredients: D-mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone K29/32, sodium starch glycolate, and sodium stearyl fumarate. The tablet film\u2011coating contains the inactive ingredients iron oxide yellow (25-mg and 50-mg tablets only), macrogol/PEG, polyvinyl alcohol-part hydrolyzed, talc, and titanium dioxide. Each TIVICAY PD tablet for oral suspension contains 5.26 mg of dolutegravir sodium, which is equivalent to 5 mg dolutegravir free acid, and the following inactive ingredients: calcium sulfate dihydrate, crospovidone, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone K29/32, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, strawberry cream flavor, sucralose, and sodium stearyl fumarate. The tablet film-coating contains hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide. dolutegravir chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Dolutegravir is an HIV-1 antiretroviral agent [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on Electrocardiogram In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, 42 healthy subjects received single-dose oral administrations of placebo, dolutegravir 250-mg suspension (exposures approximately 3\u2013fold of the 50-mg once-daily dose at steady state), and moxifloxacin 400 mg (active control) in random sequence. After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTc change based on Fridericia correction method (QTcF) for dolutegravir was 2.4 msec (1-sided 95% upper CI: 4.9 msec). TIVICAY did not prolong the QTc interval over 24 hours postdose. Effects on Renal Function The effect of dolutegravir on renal function was evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 3\u2011arm, parallel, placebo-controlled trial in healthy subjects (n = 37) who received dolutegravir 50 mg once daily (n = 12), dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily (n = 13), or placebo once daily (n = 12) for 14 days. A decrease in creatinine clearance, as determined by 24-hour urine collection, was observed with both doses of dolutegravir after 14 days of treatment in subjects who received 50 mg once daily (9% decrease) and 50 mg twice daily (13% decrease). Neither dose of dolutegravir had a significant effect on the actual glomerular filtration rate (determined by the clearance of probe drug, iohexol) or effective renal plasma flow (determined by the clearance of probe drug, para-amino hippurate) compared with the placebo. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of dolutegravir have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and HIV\u20111\u2013infected adult subjects. Exposure to dolutegravir was generally similar between healthy subjects and HIV\u20111\u2013infected subjects. The non-linear exposure of dolutegravir following 50 mg twice daily compared with 50 mg once daily in HIV\u20111\u2013infected subjects ( Table 9 ) was attributed to the use of metabolic inducers in the background antiretroviral regimens of subjects receiving dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily in clinical trials. Table 9. Dolutegravir Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimates in HIV-1\u2013Infected Adults a Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses using data from SPRING-1 and SPRING-2. b Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses using data from VIKING (ING112961) and VIKING-3. Parameter 50 mg Once Daily Geometric Mean a (%CV) 50 mg Twice Daily Geometric Mean b (%CV) AUC (0-24) (mcg \u2219 h/mL) 53.6 (27) 75.1 (35) C max (mcg/mL) 3.67 (20) 4.15 (29) C min (mcg/mL) 1.11 (46) 2.12 (47) TIVICAY tablets and TIVICAY PD tablets for oral suspension are not bioequivalent. The relative bioavailability of TIVICAY PD is approximately 1.6-fold higher than TIVICAY; therefore, the 2 dosage forms are not interchangeable on a milligram-per-milligram basis [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Absorption Following oral administration of dolutegravir, peak plasma concentrations were observed 1 to 3 hours postdose. With once-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved within approximately 5 days with average accumulation ratios for AUC, C max , and C 24 h ranging from 1.2 to 1.5. Dolutegravir plasma concentrations increased in a less than dose-proportional manner above 50 mg. Dolutegravir is a P\u2011gp substrate in vitro. The absolute bioavailability of dolutegravir has not been established. Effect of Food: TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD may be taken with or without food. Food increased the extent of absorption and slowed the rate of absorption of dolutegravir following a 50-mg dose of TIVICAY. Low-, moderate-, and high-fat meals increased dolutegravir AUC (0-\u221e) by 33%, 41%, and 66%; increased C max by 46%, 52%, and 67%; and prolonged T max to 3, 4, and 5 hours from 2 hours under fasted conditions, respectively. Distribution Dolutegravir is highly bound (greater than or equal to 98.9%) to human plasma proteins based on in vivo data and binding is independent of plasma concentration of dolutegravir. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) following 50-mg once-daily administration is estimated at 17.4 L based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF): In 12 treatment-na\u00efve subjects on dolutegravir 50 mg daily plus abacavir/lamivudine, the median dolutegravir concentration in CSF was 13.2 ng per mL (range: 3.74 ng per mL to 18.3 ng per mL) 2 to 6 hours postdose after 16 weeks of treatment. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been established. Elimination Dolutegravir has a terminal half-life of approximately 14 hours and an apparent clearance (CL/F) of 1.0 L per hour based on population pharmacokinetic analyses. Metabolism: Dolutegravir is primarily metabolized via UGT1A1 with some contribution from CYP3A. Polymorphisms in Drug \u2011 Metabolizing Enzymes: In a meta-analysis of healthy subject trials, subjects with UGT1A1 (n = 7) genotypes conferring poor dolutegravir metabolism had a 32% lower clearance of dolutegravir and 46% higher AUC compared with subjects with genotypes associated with normal metabolism via UGT1A1 (n = 41). Excretion: After a single oral dose of [ 14 C] dolutegravir, 53% of the total oral dose was excreted unchanged in feces. Thirty-one percent of the total oral dose was excreted in urine, represented by an ether glucuronide of dolutegravir (18.9% of total dose), a metabolite formed by oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose), and its hydrolytic N-dealkylation product (3.6% of total dose). Renal elimination of unchanged drug was low (less than 1% of the dose). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir were evaluated in the IMPAACT P1093 trial and in 2 weight-band-based pharmacokinetic substudies from the ODYSSEY trial. Steady-state plasma exposure at doses by weight band are summarized in Table 10 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . Mean dolutegravir AUC 0-24h and C 24h in HIV-1\u2013infected pediatric subjects were comparable to those in adults after 50 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily. Mean C max is higher in pediatrics, but the increase is not considered clinically significant as the safety profiles were similar in pediatric and adult subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] .

Patients with Hepatic Impairment: In a trial comparing 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score B) with 8 matched healthy controls, exposure of dolutegravir from a single 50-mg dose was similar between the 2 groups. The effect of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C) on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir has not been studied. Patients with Renal Impairment: In a trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics of a single 50-mg tablet of dolutegravir comparing 8 subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl less than 30 mL per min) with 8 matched healthy controls, AUC, C max , and C 24 of dolutegravir were lower by 40%, 23%, and 43%, respectively, compared with those in matched healthy subjects. Population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from SAILING and VIKING-3 trials indicated that mild and moderate renal impairment had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of dolutegravir. There is inadequate information to recommend appropriate dosing of dolutegravir in patients requiring dialysis. HBV or HCV Co-infected Patients: Population analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from adult trials indicated no clinically relevant effect of HCV co-infection on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir. There were limited data on HBV co-infection. Gender and Race: Population analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from adult trials indicated gender and race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of dolutegravir. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction trials were performed with TIVICAY and other drugs likely to be coadministered or commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions. The effects of dolutegravir on the exposure of coadministered drugs are summarized in Table 11 and the effects of coadministered drugs on the exposure of dolutegravir are summarized in Table 12 . Dosing or regimen recommendations as a result of established and other potentially significant drug-drug interactions with TIVICAY are provided in Table 8 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] .

Strand transfer biochemical assays using purified HIV-1 integrase and pre-processed substrate DNA resulted in IC 50 values of 2.7 nM and 12.6 nM. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 with mean EC 50 values of 0.5 nM (0.21 ng per mL) to 2.1 nM (0.85 ng per mL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and MT-4 cells. Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against 13 clinically diverse clade B isolates with a mean EC 50 value of 0.52 nM in a viral integrase susceptibility assay using the integrase coding region from clinical isolates. Dolutegravir demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against a panel of HIV-1 clinical isolates (3 in each group of M clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and 3 in group O) with EC 50 values ranging from 0.02 nM to 2.14 nM for HIV-1. Dolutegravir EC 50 values against 3 HIV-2 clinical isolates in PBMC assays ranged from 0.09 nM to 0.61 nM. Antiviral Activity in Combination with Other Antiviral Agents The antiviral activity of dolutegravir was not antagonistic when combined with the INSTI, raltegravir; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), efavirenz or nevirapine; the NRTIs, abacavir or stavudine; the protease inhibitors (PIs), amprenavir or lopinavir; the CCR5 co-receptor antagonist, maraviroc; or the fusion inhibitor, enfuvirtide. Dolutegravir antiviral activity was not antagonistic when combined with the HBV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, adefovir, or inhibited by the antiviral, ribavirin. Resistance Cell Culture: Dolutegravir-resistant viruses were selected in cell culture starting from different wild-type HIV-1 strains and clades. Amino acid substitutions E92Q, G118R, S153F or Y, G193E or R263K emerged in different passages and conferred decreased susceptibility to dolutegravir of up to 4-fold. Passage of mutant viruses containing the Q148R or Q148H substitutions selected for additional substitutions in integrase that conferred decreased susceptibility to dolutegravir (fold-change increase of 13 to 46). The additional integrase substitutions included T97A, E138K, G140S, and M154I. Passage of mutant viruses containing both G140S and Q148H selected for L74M, E92Q, and N155H. Treatment-Na\u00efve Subjects: No subject who received dolutegravir 50-mg once-daily in the treatment-na\u00efve trials SPRING-2 (96 weeks) and SINGLE (144 weeks) had a detectable decrease in susceptibility to dolutegravir or background NRTIs in the resistance analysis subset (n = 12 with HIV-1 RNA greater than 400 copies per mL at failure or last visit and having resistance data). Two virologic failure subjects in SINGLE had treatment-emergent G/D/E193D and G193G/E integrase substitutions at Week 84 and Week 108, respectively, and 1 subject with 275 copies per mL HIV-1 RNA had a treatment-emergent Q157Q/P integrase substitution detected at Week 24. None of these subjects had a corresponding decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility. No treatment-emergent genotypic resistance to the background regimen was observed in the dolutegravir arm in either the SPRING-2 or SINGLE trials. No treatment-emergent primary resistance substitutions were observed in either treatment group in the FLAMINGO trial through Week 96. Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Na\u00efve Subjects: In the dolutegravir arm of the SAILING trial for treatment-experienced and INSTI-na\u00efve subjects (n = 354), treatment-emergent integrase substitutions were observed in 6 of 28 (21%) subjects who had virologic failure and resistance data. In 5 of the 6 subjects\u2019 isolates emergent INSTI substitutions included L74L/M/I, Q95Q/L, V151V/I (n = 1 each), and R263K (n = 2). The change in dolutegravir phenotypic susceptibility for these 5 subject isolates was less than 2-fold. One subject isolate had pre-existing raltegravir resistance substitutions E138A, G140S, and Q148H at baseline and had additional emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions T97A and E138A/T with a corresponding 148-fold reduction in dolutegravir susceptibility at failure. In the comparator raltegravir arm, 21 of 49 (43%) subjects with post-baseline resistance data had evidence of emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions (L74M, E92Q, T97A, E138Q, G140S/A, Y143R/C, Q148H/R, V151I, N155H, E157Q, and G163K/R) and raltegravir phenotypic resistance. Virologically Suppressed Subjects: SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 are identical trials in virologically suppressed subjects receiving 2 NRTIs plus either an INSTI, an NNRTI, or a PI, that switched to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine (n = 513) or remained on their current antiviral regimen (n = 511). In the pooled SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 trials, 12 subjects (7 in SWORD-1 and 5 in SWORD-2) had confirmed virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA greater than 200 copies/mL) while receiving dolutegravir plus rilpivirine at any time through Week 148. Ten of the confirmed virologic failures had post-baseline resistance data, with 6 isolates showing evidence of rilpivirine resistance, and 2 with evidence of dolutegravir resistance substitutions. Six isolates showed genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine with emergent NNRTI-resistance substitutions E138E/A (rilpivirine 1.6-fold change), M230M/L (rilpivirine 2-fold change), L100L/I, K101Q, and E138A (rilpivirine 4.1-fold change), K101K/E (rilpivirine 1.2-fold change), K101K/E, M230M/L (rilpivirine 2-fold change), and L100L/V/M, M230M/L (rilpivirine 31-fold change). In addition, 1 virologic failure subject had NNRTI\u2011resistance substitutions K103N and V179I at Week 88 with rilpivirine phenotypic fold change of 5.2 but had no baseline sample. One virologic failure isolate had emergent INSTI\u2011resistance substitution V151V/I present post-baseline with baseline INSTI\u2011resistance substitutions N155N/H and G163G/R (by exploratory HIV proviral DNA archive sequencing); no integrase phenotypic data were available for this isolate at virologic failure. One other subject had the dolutegravir resistance substitution G193E at baseline and virologic failure, but no detectable phenotypic resistance (fold change = 1.02) at Week 24. No resistance-associated substitutions were observed for the 2 subjects meeting confirmed virologic failure in the comparative current antiretroviral regimen arms at Week 48. Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Experienced Subjects: VIKING-3 examined the efficacy of dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily plus optimized background therapy in subjects with prior or current virologic failure on an INSTI- (elvitegravir or raltegravir) containing regimen. Use of TIVICAY in INSTI-experienced patients should be guided by the number and type of baseline INSTI substitutions. The efficacy of TIVICAY 50 mg twice daily is reduced in patients with an INSTI-resistance Q148 substitution plus 2 or more additional INSTI-resistance substitutions, including T66A, L74I/M, E138A/K/T, G140S/A/C, Y143R/C/H, E157Q, G163S/E/K/Q, or G193E/R. Response by Baseline Genotype Of the 183 subjects with baseline data, 30% harbored virus with a substitution at Q148, and 33% had no primary INSTI-resistance substitutions (T66A/I/K, E92Q/V, Y143R/C/H, Q148H/R/K, and N155H) at baseline, but had historical genotypic evidence of INSTI-resistance substitutions, phenotypic evidence of elvitegravir or raltegravir resistance, or genotypic evidence of INSTI-resistance substitutions at screening. Response rates by baseline genotype were analyzed in an \u201cas-treated\u201d analysis at Week 48 (n = 175) ( Table 13 ). The response rate at Week 48 to dolutegravir-containing regimens was 47% (24 of 51) when Q148 substitutions were present at baseline; Q148 was always present with additional INSTI-resistance substitutions ( Table 13 ). In addition, a diminished virologic response of 40% (6 of 15) was observed when the substitution E157Q or K was present at baseline with other INSTI-resistance substitutions but without a Q148H or R substitution. Table 13. Response by Baseline Integrase Genotype in Subjects with Prior Experience to an Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor in VIKING-3 INSTI = integrase strand transfer inhibitor. a Includes INSTI-resistance substitutions Y143R/C/H and N155H. b INSTI-resistance substitutions included T66A, L74I/M, E138A/K/T, G140S/A/C, Y143R/C/H, E157Q, G163S/E/K/Q, or G193E/R. Two additional subjects had baseline genotypes of Q148Q/R plus L74L/I/M (virologic failure) and Q148R plus E138K (responder). c The most common pathway with Q148H/R + greater than or equal to 2 INSTI-resistance substitutions had Q148+G140+E138 substitutions (n = 16). Baseline Genotype Week 48 (<50 copies/mL) n = 175 Overall Response 66% (116/175) No Q148 substitution a 74% (92/124) Q148H/R + G140S/A/C without additional INSTI-resistance substitution b 61% (17/28) Q148H/R + \u22652 INSTI-resistance substitutions b,c 29% (6/21) Response by Baseline Phenotype Response rates by baseline phenotype were analyzed in an as-treated analysis using all subjects with available baseline phenotypes through Week 48 (n = 163) ( Table 14 ). These baseline phenotypic groups are based on subjects enrolled in VIKING-3 and are not meant to represent definitive clinical susceptibility cut points for dolutegravir. The data are provided to guide clinicians on the likelihood of virologic success based on pretreatment susceptibility to dolutegravir in INSTI-resistant patients. Table 14. Response by Baseline Dolutegravir Phenotype (Fold-Change from Reference) in Subjects with Prior Experience to an Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor in VIKING-3 Baseline Dolutegravir Phenotype (Fold-Change from Reference) Response at Week 48 (<50 copies/mL) Subset n = 163 Overall Response 64% (104/163) <3-fold change 72% (83/116) 3- <10-fold change 53% (18/34) \u226510-fold change 23% (3/13) Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor Treatment-Emergent Resistance There were 50 subjects with virologic failure on the dolutegravir twice-daily regimen in VIKING-3 with HIV-1 RNA greater than 400 copies per mL at the failure timepoint, Week 48 or beyond, or the last timepoint on trial. Thirty-nine subjects with virologic failure had resistance data that were used in the Week 48 analysis. In the Week 48 resistance analysis 85% (33 of 39) of the subjects with virologic failure had treatment-emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions in their isolates. The most common treatment-emergent INSTI-resistance substitution was T97A. Other frequently emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions included L74M, I or V, E138K or A, G140S, Q148H, R or K, M154I, or N155H. Substitutions E92Q, Y143R or C/H, S147G, V151A, and E157E/Q each emerged in 1 to 3 subjects\u2019 isolates. At failure, the median dolutegravir fold-change from reference was 61-fold (range: 0.75 to 209) for isolates with emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions (n = 33). Resistance to one or more background drugs in the dolutegravir twice-daily regimen also emerged in 49% (19 of 39) of subjects in the Week 48 resistance analysis . In VIKING-4 (ING116529), 30 subjects with current virological failure on an INSTI-containing regimen and genotypic evidence of INSTI-resistance substitutions at screening were randomized to receive either dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily or placebo with the current failing regimen for 7 days and then all subjects received open-label dolutegravir plus optimized background regimen from Day 8. Virologic responses at Week 48 by baseline genotypic and phenotypic INSTI-resistance categories and the INSTI resistance-associated substitutions that emerged on dolutegravir treatment in VIKING-4 were consistent with those seen in VIKING-3. Cross-Resistance Site-Directed Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Resistant Mutant HIV-1 and HIV-2 Strains: The susceptibility of dolutegravir was tested against 60 INSTI-resistant site-directed mutant HIV-1 viruses (28 with single substitutions and 32 with 2 or more substitutions) and 6 INSTI-resistant site-directed mutant HIV-2 viruses. The single INSTI-resistance substitutions T66K, I151L, and S153Y conferred a greater than 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.3-fold to 3.6-fold from reference). Combinations of multiple substitutions T66K/L74M, E92Q/N155H, G140C/Q148R, G140S/Q148H, R or K, Q148R/N155H, T97A/G140S/Q148, and substitutions at E138/G140/Q148 showed a greater than 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.5-fold to 21-fold from reference). In HIV-2 mutants, combinations of substitutions A153G/N155H/S163G and E92Q/T97A/N155H/S163D conferred 4-fold decreases in dolutegravir susceptibility, and E92Q/N155H and G140S/Q148R showed 8.5-fold and 17-fold decreases in dolutegravir susceptibility, respectively. Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor- and Protease Inhibitor-Resistant Strains: Dolutegravir demonstrated equivalent antiviral activity against 2 NNRTI-resistant, 3 NRTI-resistant, and 2 PI-resistant HIV-1 mutant clones compared with the wild-type strain."], "clinical_pharmacology_table": ["<table width=\"100%\"><caption>Table 9.

After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTc change based on Fridericia correction method (QTcF) for dolutegravir was 2.4 msec (1-sided 95% upper CI: 4.9 msec). TIVICAY did not prolong the QTc interval over 24 hours postdose. Effects on Renal Function The effect of dolutegravir on renal function was evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 3\u2011arm, parallel, placebo-controlled trial in healthy subjects (n = 37) who received dolutegravir 50 mg once daily (n = 12), dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily (n = 13), or placebo once daily (n = 12) for 14 days. A decrease in creatinine clearance, as determined by 24-hour urine collection, was observed with both doses of dolutegravir after 14 days of treatment in subjects who received 50 mg once daily (9% decrease) and 50 mg twice daily (13% decrease). Neither dose of dolutegravir had a significant effect on the actual glomerular filtration rate (determined by the clearance of probe drug, iohexol) or effective renal plasma flow (determined by the clearance of probe drug, para-amino hippurate) compared with the placebo."], "pharmacokinetics": ["12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of dolutegravir have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and HIV\u20111\u2013infected adult subjects. Exposure to dolutegravir was generally similar between healthy subjects and HIV\u20111\u2013infected subjects. The non-linear exposure of dolutegravir following 50 mg twice daily compared with 50 mg once daily in HIV\u20111\u2013infected subjects ( Table 9 ) was attributed to the use of metabolic inducers in the background antiretroviral regimens of subjects receiving dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily in clinical trials. Table 9. Dolutegravir Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimates in HIV-1\u2013Infected Adults a Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses using data from SPRING-1 and SPRING-2. b Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses using data from VIKING (ING112961) and VIKING-3. Parameter 50 mg Once Daily Geometric Mean a (%CV) 50 mg Twice Daily Geometric Mean b (%CV) AUC (0-24) (mcg \u2219 h/mL) 53.6 (27) 75.1 (35) C max (mcg/mL) 3.67 (20) 4.15 (29) C min (mcg/mL) 1.11 (46) 2.12 (47) TIVICAY tablets and TIVICAY PD tablets for oral suspension are not bioequivalent. The relative bioavailability of TIVICAY PD is approximately 1.6-fold higher than TIVICAY; therefore, the 2 dosage forms are not interchangeable on a milligram-per-milligram basis [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Absorption Following oral administration of dolutegravir, peak plasma concentrations were observed 1 to 3 hours postdose. With once-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved within approximately 5 days with average accumulation ratios for AUC, C max , and C 24 h ranging from 1.2 to 1.5. Dolutegravir plasma concentrations increased in a less than dose-proportional manner above 50 mg. Dolutegravir is a P\u2011gp substrate in vitro. The absolute bioavailability of dolutegravir has not been established. Effect of Food: TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD may be taken with or without food. Food increased the extent of absorption and slowed the rate of absorption of dolutegravir following a 50-mg dose of TIVICAY. Low-, moderate-, and high-fat meals increased dolutegravir AUC (0-\u221e) by 33%, 41%, and 66%; increased C max by 46%, 52%, and 67%; and prolonged T max to 3, 4, and 5 hours from 2 hours under fasted conditions, respectively. Distribution Dolutegravir is highly bound (greater than or equal to 98.9%) to human plasma proteins based on in vivo data and binding is independent of plasma concentration of dolutegravir. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) following 50-mg once-daily administration is estimated at 17.4 L based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF): In 12 treatment-na\u00efve subjects on dolutegravir 50 mg daily plus abacavir/lamivudine, the median dolutegravir concentration in CSF was 13.2 ng per mL (range: 3.74 ng per mL to 18.3 ng per mL) 2 to 6 hours postdose after 16 weeks of treatment. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been established. Elimination Dolutegravir has a terminal half-life of approximately 14 hours and an apparent clearance (CL/F) of 1.0 L per hour based on population pharmacokinetic analyses. Metabolism: Dolutegravir is primarily metabolized via UGT1A1 with some contribution from CYP3A. Polymorphisms in Drug \u2011 Metabolizing Enzymes: In a meta-analysis of healthy subject trials, subjects with UGT1A1 (n = 7) genotypes conferring poor dolutegravir metabolism had a 32% lower clearance of dolutegravir and 46% higher AUC compared with subjects with genotypes associated with normal metabolism via UGT1A1 (n = 41). Excretion: After a single oral dose of [ 14 C] dolutegravir, 53% of the total oral dose was excreted unchanged in feces. Thirty-one percent of the total oral dose was excreted in urine, represented by an ether glucuronide of dolutegravir (18.9% of total dose), a metabolite formed by oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose), and its hydrolytic N-dealkylation product (3.6% of total dose). Renal elimination of unchanged drug was low (less than 1% of the dose). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir were evaluated in the IMPAACT P1093 trial and in 2 weight-band-based pharmacokinetic substudies from the ODYSSEY trial. Steady-state plasma exposure at doses by weight band are summarized in Table 10 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . Mean dolutegravir AUC 0-24h and C 24h in HIV-1\u2013infected pediatric subjects were comparable to those in adults after 50 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily. Mean C max is higher in pediatrics, but the increase is not considered clinically significant as the safety profiles were similar in pediatric and adult subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Table 10. Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Pediatric HIV-1\u2013Infected Subjects (Pooled Analyses for IMPAACT P1093 and ODYSSEY a Trials) a Data from 2 weight-band-based pharmacokinetic substudies in the ODYSSEY trial. b The bioavailability of TIVICAY PD tablets for oral suspension is ~1.6-fold that of TIVICAY tablets.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment: In a trial comparing 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score B) with 8 matched healthy controls, exposure of dolutegravir from a single 50-mg dose was similar between the 2 groups. The effect of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C) on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir has not been studied. Patients with Renal Impairment: In a trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics of a single 50-mg tablet of dolutegravir comparing 8 subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl less than 30 mL per min) with 8 matched healthy controls, AUC, C max , and C 24 of dolutegravir were lower by 40%, 23%, and 43%, respectively, compared with those in matched healthy subjects. Population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from SAILING and VIKING-3 trials indicated that mild and moderate renal impairment had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of dolutegravir. There is inadequate information to recommend appropriate dosing of dolutegravir in patients requiring dialysis. HBV or HCV Co-infected Patients: Population analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from adult trials indicated no clinically relevant effect of HCV co-infection on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir. There were limited data on HBV co-infection. Gender and Race: Population analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from adult trials indicated gender and race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of dolutegravir. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction trials were performed with TIVICAY and other drugs likely to be coadministered or commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions. The effects of dolutegravir on the exposure of coadministered drugs are summarized in Table 11 and the effects of coadministered drugs on the exposure of dolutegravir are summarized in Table 12 . Dosing or regimen recommendations as a result of established and other potentially significant drug-drug interactions with TIVICAY are provided in Table 8 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] .

strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. Strand transfer biochemical assays using purified HIV-1 integrase and pre-processed substrate DNA resulted in IC 50 values of 2.7 nM and 12.6 nM. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 with mean EC 50 values of 0.5 nM (0.21 ng per mL) to 2.1 nM (0.85 ng per mL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and MT-4 cells. Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against 13 clinically diverse clade B isolates with a mean EC 50 value of 0.52 nM in a viral integrase susceptibility assay using the integrase coding region from clinical isolates. Dolutegravir demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against a panel of HIV-1 clinical isolates (3 in each group of M clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and 3 in group O) with EC 50 values ranging from 0.02 nM to 2.14 nM for HIV-1. Dolutegravir EC 50 values against 3 HIV-2 clinical isolates in PBMC assays ranged from 0.09 nM to 0.61 nM. Antiviral Activity in Combination with Other Antiviral Agents The antiviral activity of dolutegravir was not antagonistic when combined with the INSTI, raltegravir; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), efavirenz or nevirapine; the NRTIs, abacavir or stavudine; the protease inhibitors (PIs), amprenavir or lopinavir; the CCR5 co-receptor antagonist, maraviroc; or the fusion inhibitor, enfuvirtide. Dolutegravir antiviral activity was not antagonistic when combined with the HBV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, adefovir, or inhibited by the antiviral, ribavirin. Resistance Cell Culture: Dolutegravir-resistant viruses were selected in cell culture starting from different wild-type HIV-1 strains and clades. Amino acid substitutions E92Q, G118R, S153F or Y, G193E or R263K emerged in different passages and conferred decreased susceptibility to dolutegravir of up to 4-fold. Passage of mutant viruses containing the Q148R or Q148H substitutions selected for additional substitutions in integrase that conferred decreased susceptibility to dolutegravir (fold-change increase of 13 to 46). The additional integrase substitutions included T97A, E138K, G140S, and M154I. Passage of mutant viruses containing both G140S and Q148H selected for L74M, E92Q, and N155H. Treatment-Na\u00efve Subjects: No subject who received dolutegravir 50-mg once-daily in the treatment-na\u00efve trials SPRING-2 (96 weeks) and SINGLE (144 weeks) had a detectable decrease in susceptibility to dolutegravir or background NRTIs in the resistance analysis subset (n = 12 with HIV-1 RNA greater than 400 copies per mL at failure or last visit and having resistance data). Two virologic failure subjects in SINGLE had treatment-emergent G/D/E193D and G193G/E integrase substitutions at Week 84 and Week 108, respectively, and 1 subject with 275 copies per mL HIV-1 RNA had a treatment-emergent Q157Q/P integrase substitution detected at Week 24. None of these subjects had a corresponding decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility. No treatment-emergent genotypic resistance to the background regimen was observed in the dolutegravir arm in either the SPRING-2 or SINGLE trials. No treatment-emergent primary resistance substitutions were observed in either treatment group in the FLAMINGO trial through Week 96. Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Na\u00efve Subjects: In the dolutegravir arm of the SAILING trial for treatment-experienced and INSTI-na\u00efve subjects (n = 354), treatment-emergent integrase substitutions were observed in 6 of 28 (21%) subjects who had virologic failure and resistance data. In 5 of the 6 subjects\u2019 isolates emergent INSTI substitutions included L74L/M/I, Q95Q/L, V151V/I (n = 1 each), and R263K (n = 2). The change in dolutegravir phenotypic susceptibility for these 5 subject isolates was less than 2-fold. One subject isolate had pre-existing raltegravir resistance substitutions E138A, G140S, and Q148H at baseline and had additional emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions T97A and E138A/T with a corresponding 148-fold reduction in dolutegravir susceptibility at failure. In the comparator raltegravir arm, 21 of 49 (43%) subjects with post-baseline resistance data had evidence of emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions (L74M, E92Q, T97A, E138Q, G140S/A, Y143R/C, Q148H/R, V151I, N155H, E157Q, and G163K/R) and raltegravir phenotypic resistance. Virologically Suppressed Subjects: SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 are identical trials in virologically suppressed subjects receiving 2 NRTIs plus either an INSTI, an NNRTI, or a PI, that switched to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine (n = 513) or remained on their current antiviral regimen (n = 511). In the pooled SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 trials, 12 subjects (7 in SWORD-1 and 5 in SWORD-2) had confirmed virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA greater than 200 copies/mL) while receiving dolutegravir plus rilpivirine at any time through Week 148. Ten of the confirmed virologic failures had post-baseline resistance data, with 6 isolates showing evidence of rilpivirine resistance, and 2 with evidence of dolutegravir resistance substitutions. Six isolates showed genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine with emergent NNRTI-resistance substitutions E138E/A (rilpivirine 1.6-fold change), M230M/L (rilpivirine 2-fold change), L100L/I, K101Q, and E138A (rilpivirine 4.1-fold change), K101K/E (rilpivirine 1.2-fold change), K101K/E, M230M/L (rilpivirine 2-fold change), and L100L/V/M, M230M/L (rilpivirine 31-fold change). In addition, 1 virologic failure subject had NNRTI\u2011resistance substitutions K103N and V179I at Week 88 with rilpivirine phenotypic fold change of 5.2 but had no baseline sample. One virologic failure isolate had emergent INSTI\u2011resistance substitution V151V/I present post-baseline with baseline INSTI\u2011resistance substitutions N155N/H and G163G/R (by exploratory HIV proviral DNA archive sequencing); no integrase phenotypic data were available for this isolate at virologic failure. One other subject had the dolutegravir resistance substitution G193E at baseline and virologic failure, but no detectable phenotypic resistance (fold change = 1.02) at Week 24. No resistance-associated substitutions were observed for the 2 subjects meeting confirmed virologic failure in the comparative current antiretroviral regimen arms at Week 48. Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Experienced Subjects: VIKING-3 examined the efficacy of dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily plus optimized background therapy in subjects with prior or current virologic failure on an INSTI- (elvitegravir or raltegravir) containing regimen. Use of TIVICAY in INSTI-experienced patients should be guided by the number and type of baseline INSTI substitutions. The efficacy of TIVICAY 50 mg twice daily is reduced in patients with an INSTI-resistance Q148 substitution plus 2 or more additional INSTI-resistance substitutions, including T66A, L74I/M, E138A/K/T, G140S/A/C, Y143R/C/H, E157Q, G163S/E/K/Q, or G193E/R. Response by Baseline Genotype Of the 183 subjects with baseline data, 30% harbored virus with a substitution at Q148, and 33% had no primary INSTI-resistance substitutions (T66A/I/K, E92Q/V, Y143R/C/H, Q148H/R/K, and N155H) at baseline, but had historical genotypic evidence of INSTI-resistance substitutions, phenotypic evidence of elvitegravir or raltegravir resistance, or genotypic evidence of INSTI-resistance substitutions at screening. Response rates by baseline genotype were analyzed in an \u201cas-treated\u201d analysis at Week 48 (n = 175) ( Table 13 ). The response rate at Week 48 to dolutegravir-containing regimens was 47% (24 of 51) when Q148 substitutions were present at baseline; Q148 was always present with additional INSTI-resistance substitutions ( Table 13 ). In addition, a diminished virologic response of 40% (6 of 15) was observed when the substitution E157Q or K was present at baseline with other INSTI-resistance substitutions but without a Q148H or R substitution.

Two additional subjects had baseline genotypes of Q148Q/R plus L74L/I/M (virologic failure) and Q148R plus E138K (responder). c The most common pathway with Q148H/R + greater than or equal to 2 INSTI-resistance substitutions had Q148+G140+E138 substitutions (n = 16).

These baseline phenotypic groups are based on subjects enrolled in VIKING-3 and are not meant to represent definitive clinical susceptibility cut points for dolutegravir. The data are provided to guide clinicians on the likelihood of virologic success based on pretreatment susceptibility to dolutegravir in INSTI-resistant patients. Table 14. Response by Baseline Dolutegravir Phenotype (Fold-Change from Reference) in Subjects with Prior Experience to an Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor in VIKING-3 Baseline Dolutegravir Phenotype (Fold-Change from Reference) Response at Week 48 (<50 copies/mL) Subset n = 163 Overall Response 64% (104/163) <3-fold change 72% (83/116) 3- <10-fold change 53% (18/34) \u226510-fold change 23% (3/13) Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor Treatment-Emergent Resistance There were 50 subjects with virologic failure on the dolutegravir twice-daily regimen in VIKING-3 with HIV-1 RNA greater than 400 copies per mL at the failure timepoint, Week 48 or beyond, or the last timepoint on trial. Thirty-nine subjects with virologic failure had resistance data that were used in the Week 48 analysis. In the Week 48 resistance analysis 85% (33 of 39) of the subjects with virologic failure had treatment-emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions in their isolates. The most common treatment-emergent INSTI-resistance substitution was T97A. Other frequently emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions included L74M, I or V, E138K or A, G140S, Q148H, R or K, M154I, or N155H. Substitutions E92Q, Y143R or C/H, S147G, V151A, and E157E/Q each emerged in 1 to 3 subjects\u2019 isolates. At failure, the median dolutegravir fold-change from reference was 61-fold (range: 0.75 to 209) for isolates with emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions (n = 33). Resistance to one or more background drugs in the dolutegravir twice-daily regimen also emerged in 49% (19 of 39) of subjects in the Week 48 resistance analysis . In VIKING-4 (ING116529), 30 subjects with current virological failure on an INSTI-containing regimen and genotypic evidence of INSTI-resistance substitutions at screening were randomized to receive either dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily or placebo with the current failing regimen for 7 days and then all subjects received open-label dolutegravir plus optimized background regimen from Day 8. Virologic responses at Week 48 by baseline genotypic and phenotypic INSTI-resistance categories and the INSTI resistance-associated substitutions that emerged on dolutegravir treatment in VIKING-4 were consistent with those seen in VIKING-3. Cross-Resistance Site-Directed Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Resistant Mutant HIV-1 and HIV-2 Strains: The susceptibility of dolutegravir was tested against 60 INSTI-resistant site-directed mutant HIV-1 viruses (28 with single substitutions and 32 with 2 or more substitutions) and 6 INSTI-resistant site-directed mutant HIV-2 viruses. The single INSTI-resistance substitutions T66K, I151L, and S153Y conferred a greater than 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.3-fold to 3.6-fold from reference). Combinations of multiple substitutions T66K/L74M, E92Q/N155H, G140C/Q148R, G140S/Q148H, R or K, Q148R/N155H, T97A/G140S/Q148, and substitutions at E138/G140/Q148 showed a greater than 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.5-fold to 21-fold from reference). In HIV-2 mutants, combinations of substitutions A153G/N155H/S163G and E92Q/T97A/N155H/S163D conferred 4-fold decreases in dolutegravir susceptibility, and E92Q/N155H and G140S/Q148R showed 8.5-fold and 17-fold decreases in dolutegravir susceptibility, respectively. Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor- and Protease Inhibitor-Resistant Strains: Dolutegravir demonstrated equivalent antiviral activity against 2 NNRTI-resistant, 3 NRTI-resistant, and 2 PI-resistant HIV-1 mutant clones compared with the wild-type strain."], "microbiology_table": ["<table width=\"100%\"><caption>Table 13.

The median change in CD4+ cell counts from baseline was 276 cells per mm 3 in the group receiving TIVICAY and 264 cells per mm 3 for the raltegravir group at 96 weeks. There was no treatment-emergent resistance to dolutegravir or to the NRTI background. SINGLE: Treatment differences were maintained across baseline characteristics including baseline viral load, CD4+ cell count, age, gender, and race. The adjusted mean changes in CD4+ cell counts from baseline were 378 cells per mm 3 in the group receiving TIVICAY + EPZICOM and 332 cells per mm 3 for the ATRIPLA group at 144 weeks. The adjusted difference between treatment arms and 95% CI was 46.9 cells per mm 3 (15.6 cells per mm 3 , 78.2 cells per mm 3 ) (adjusted for pre-specified stratification factors: baseline HIV-1 RNA, and baseline CD4+ cell count). There was no treatment-emergent resistance to dolutegravir, abacavir, or lamivudine. FLAMINGO: In FLAMINGO, 485 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either TIVICAY 50 mg once daily (n = 243) or darunavir + ritonavir 800 mg/100 mg once daily (n = 242), both in combination with investigator-selected NRTI background regimen (either fixed-dose abacavir and lamivudine [EPZICOM] or fixed-dose emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TRUVADA]). There were 484 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 34 years, 15% female, 28% non-white, 10% had hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 3% were CDC Class C (AIDS), 25% had HIV\u20111 RNA greater than 100,000 copies per mL, and 35% had CD4+ cell count less than 350 cells per mm 3 ; these characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Overall response rates by Snapshot algorithm through Week 96 were 80% for TIVICAY and 68% for darunavir/ritonavir. The proportion of subjects who were non-responders (HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies per mL) at Week 96 was 8% and 12% in the arms receiving TIVICAY and darunavir + ritonavir, respectively; no virologic data were available for 12% and 21% for subjects treated with TIVICAY and darunavir + ritonavir, respectively. The adjusted overall response rate difference in proportion and 95% CI was 12.4% (4.7%, 20.2%). No treatment-emergent primary resistance substitutions were observed in either treatment group. Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Na\u00efve Subjects In the international, multicenter, double-blind trial (SAILING), 719 HIV\u20111\u2013infected, antiretroviral treatment-experienced adults were randomized and received either TIVICAY 50 mg once daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily with investigator-selected background regimen consisting of up to 2 agents, including at least 1 fully active agent. There were 715 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. At baseline, the median age was 43 years, 32% were female, 50% non-white, 16% had hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 46% were CDC Class C (AIDS), 20% had HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies per mL, and 72% had CD4+ cell count less than 350 cells per mm 3 ; these characteristics were similar between treatment groups. All subjects had at least 2-class antiretroviral treatment resistance, and 49% of subjects had at least 3-class antiretroviral treatment resistance at baseline. Week 48 outcomes for SAILING are shown in Table 17 . Table 17. Virologic Outcomes of Randomized Treatment in SAILING at 48 Weeks (Snapshot Algorithm) a BR = Background regimen.

The mean changes in CD4+ cell counts from baseline were 162 cells per mm 3 in the group receiving TIVICAY and 153 cells per mm 3 in the raltegravir group. Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Experienced Subjects VIKING-3 examined the effect of TIVICAY 50 mg twice daily over 7 days of functional monotherapy, followed by OBT with continued treatment of TIVICAY 50 mg twice daily. In the multicenter, open-label, single-arm VIKING-3 trial, 183 HIV\u20111\u2013infected, antiretroviral treatment-experienced adults with virological failure and current or historical evidence of raltegravir and/or elvitegravir resistance received TIVICAY 50 mg twice daily with the current failing background regimen for 7 days, then received TIVICAY with OBT from Day 8. A total of 183 subjects enrolled: 133 subjects with INSTI resistance at screening and 50 subjects with only historical evidence of resistance (and not at screening). At baseline, median age of subjects was 48 years; 23% were female, 29% non-white, and 20% had hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection. Median baseline CD4+ cell count was 140 cells per mm 3 , median duration of prior antiretroviral treatment was 13 years, and 56% were CDC Class C. Subjects showed multiple-class antiretroviral treatment resistance at baseline: 79% had greater than or equal to 2 NRTI, 75% greater than or equal to 1 NNRTI, and 71% greater than or equal to 2 PI major substitutions; 62% had non-R5 virus. Mean reduction from baseline in HIV-1 RNA at Day 8 (primary endpoint) was 1.4 log 10 (95% CI: 1.3 log 10 , 1.5 log 10 ). Response at Week 48 was affected by baseline INSTI substitutions [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )] . After the functional monotherapy phase, subjects had the opportunity to re-optimize their background regimen when possible. Week 48 virologic outcomes for VIKING-3 are shown in Table 18 . Table 18. Virologic Outcomes of Treatment of VIKING-3 at 48 Weeks (Snapshot Algorithm) OBT = Optimized Background Therapy.

The median change in CD4+ cell count from baseline was 80 cells per mm 3 at Week 48. Virologically Suppressed Subjects SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 are identical 148-week, Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority trials. A total of 1,024 adult HIV-1\u2013infected subjects who were on a stable suppressive antiretroviral regimen (containing 2 NRTIs plus either an INSTI, an NNRTI, or a PI) for at least 6 months (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL), with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to dolutegravir or rilpivirine received treatment in the trials. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to continue their current antiretroviral regimen (n\u00b0= 511) or be switched to TIVICAY 50 mg plus rilpivirine 25 mg administered once daily (n = 513). Subjects originally assigned to continue their current antiretroviral regimen and who remained virologically suppressed at Week 48 switched to TIVICAY plus rilpivirine at Week 52 (n = 477). The primary efficacy endpoint for the SWORD trial was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at Week 48. The proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at Week 48 was 95% for both treatment groups; treatment difference and 95% CI was -0.2% (-3.0%, 2.5%). The proportion of subjects with HIV\u20111 RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies per mL (virologic failure) at Week 48 was 0.6% and 1.2% for the dolutegravir plus rilpivirine treatment group and the current antiretroviral regimen treatment groups, respectively; treatment difference and 95% CI was -0.6% (-1.7%, 0.6%). At Week 148 in the pooled SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 trials, 84% of subjects who received TIVICAY plus rilpivirine from study start had plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL (Snapshot algorithm). In subjects who initially remained on their current antiretroviral regimen and switched to TIVICAY plus rilpivirine at Week 52, 90% had plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL at Week 148 (Snapshot algorithm), which was comparable to the response rate (89%) observed at Week 100 (similar exposure duration) in subjects receiving TIVICAY plus rilpivirine from study start. Refer to the prescribing information for JULUCA (dolutegravir and rilpivirine) tablet for complete virologic outcome information. 14.3 Pediatric Subjects IMPAACT P1093 is an ongoing Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD in combination treatment regimens in HIV-1\u2013infected infants, children, and adolescents aged at least 4 weeks to 18 years. Subjects were stratified by 5 age cohorts: Cohort 1, aged 12 to less than 18 years; Cohort 2A, aged 6 to less than 12 years; Cohort 3, aged 2 to less than 6 years; Cohort 4, aged 6 months to less than 2 years; and Cohort 5, aged 4 weeks to less than 6 months. Seventy-five subjects received the recommended dose (determined by weight and age) of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 )] . These 75 subjects had a median age of 27 months (range: 1 to 214), were 59% female, and 68% were black or African American. At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.4 log 10 copies per mL, median CD4+ cell count was 1,225 cells per mm 3 (range: 1 to 8,255), and median CD4+% was 23% (range: 0.3% to 49%). Overall, 33% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than 50,000 copies per mL and 12% had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category C. The majority (80%) of subjects were treatment-experienced, but all were INSTI-na\u00efve. Most subjects had previously used at least 1 NNRTI (44%) or 1 PI (76%). Virologic outcomes from IMPAACT P1093 include subjects who received either TIVICAY tablets or TIVICAY PD tablets for oral suspension as per the dosing recommendations for their weight band and who had reached Week 24 (n = 58) or Week 48 (n = 42). At Week 24, 62% of subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL and 86% achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL (Snapshot algorithm). The median CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 105 cells per mm 3 (5%). At Week 48, 69% of subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL and 79% achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL (Snapshot algorithm). The median CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 48 was 141 cells per mm 3 (7%)."], "clinical_studies_table": ["<table width=\"100%\"><caption>Table 15.

Hallucinations / Psychotic Behavior: Consider dosage reduction or stopping NOURIANZ if occurs ( 5.2 ). Impulse Control / Compulsive Behaviors: Consider dosage reduction or stopping NOURIANZ if occurs ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Dyskinesia NOURIANZ in combination with levodopa may cause dyskinesia or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia. In controlled clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , the incidence of dyskinesia was 15% for NOURIANZ 20 mg, 17% for NOURIANZ 40 mg, and 8% for placebo, in combination with levodopa. One percent of patients treated with either NOURIANZ 20 mg or 40 mg discontinued treatment because of dyskinesia, compared to 0% for placebo. 5.2 Hallucinations / Psychotic Behavior Because of the potential risk of exacerbating psychosis, patients with a major psychotic disorder should not be treated with NOURIANZ. Consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if a patient develops hallucinations or psychotic behaviors while taking NOURIANZ. In controlled clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , the incidence of hallucinations was 2% for NOURIANZ 20 mg, 6% for NOURIANZ 40 mg, and 3% for placebo. In patients treated with NOURIANZ 40 mg, 1% discontinued because of hallucinations, compared to 0% for placebo and 0% for patients treated with NOURIANZ 20 mg. The incidence of \"abnormal thinking and behavior\" (paranoid ideation, delusions, confusion, mania, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, or delirium) reported as an adverse reaction was 1% for NOURIANZ 20 mg, 2% for NOURIANZ 40 mg, and 1% for placebo. 5.3 Impulse Control / Compulsive Behaviors Patients treated with NOURIANZ and one or more medication(s) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (including levodopa) may experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges. In controlled clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , one patient treated with NOURIANZ 40 mg was reported to have impulse control disorder, compared to no patient on placebo or NOURIANZ 20 mg. In some postmarketing cases, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced, or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with NOURIANZ. Consider dose reduction or discontinuation if a patient develops such urges while taking NOURIANZ [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] ."], "adverse_reactions": ["6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hallucinations / Psychotic Behavior [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Impulse Control / Compulsive Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions (at least 5% and more frequent than placebo) were dyskinesia, dizziness, constipation, nausea, hallucination, and insomnia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Kyowa Kirin Inc. at 1-844-768-3544 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of NOURIANZ was evaluated in 734 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) taking a stable dose of levodopa and a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, with or without other PD medications, in four randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials 12 weeks in duration (Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Of the patient population exposed to NOURIANZ, 50% were male, 32% White, 67% Asian, and the mean age was 65 years (range: 33 to 84 years). Of these patients, 356 received NOURIANZ 20 mg and 378 received NOURIANZ 40 mg. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment The incidence of patients discontinuing for any adverse reaction was 5% for NOURIANZ 20 mg, 6% for NOURIANZ 40 mg, and 5% for placebo. The most frequently reported adverse reaction causing study discontinuation was dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Common Adverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials Table 1 shows adverse reactions with a frequency of at least 2% in patients treated with NOURIANZ 20 mg or 40 mg once daily. The most common adverse reactions in which the frequency for NOURIANZ was at least 5%, and greater than the incidence on placebo, were dyskinesia, dizziness, constipation, nausea, hallucination, and insomnia.

Therefore, the recommended maximum dosage of NOURIANZ in patients concomitantly using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin) is 20 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of NOURIANZ with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) decreased istradefylline C max and AUC inf by 45% and 81%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, it is recommended to avoid use of NOURIANZ with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phenytoin, St. John's wort) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 7.2 Effect of NOURIANZ on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Coadministration of NOURIANZ 20 mg with a CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam) did not affect the CYP3A4 substrate exposure, while concomitant administration of NOURIANZ 40 mg increased the CYP3A4 substrate (atorvastatin) C max and AUC inf by 1.5-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

In animal studies ( see Data ), oral administration of istradefylline during pregnancy resulted in teratogenicity (increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, embryofetal and offspring mortality and growth deficits) at clinically relevant exposures and in the absence of maternal toxicity. The teratogenic effects of istradefylline in pregnant rabbits were substantially greater when administered in combination with levodopa/carbidopa than when administered alone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of istradefylline (0, 40, 200, or 1000 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal skeletal and visceral variations at the highest dose tested. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rats (200 mg/kg/day) is approximately 4 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg. Oral administration of istradefylline (0, 50, 200, or 800 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in increased embryofetal mortality at the mid and high doses, increased fetal malformations (external, visceral, skeletal) at all doses, and reduced fetal body weight at the highest dose tested. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits was not identified. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose tested (50 mg/kg/day) is less than that in humans at the MRHD. In pregnant rabbits, oral administration of istradefylline (0, 50, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day) alone or in combination with oral levodopa/carbidopa (80/20 mg/kg/day) throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in an increase in embryofetal mortality and an increase (marked at the high dose) in malformations (including limb reduction, craniofacial, and cardiovascular) in fetuses from rats administered istradefylline at all doses in combination with levodopa/carbidopa. Istradefylline alone resulted in an increase in embryofetal mortality and visceral malformations; no increase in fetal malformations was observed with levodopa/carbidopa alone. Fetal body weight was reduced by istradefylline alone (400 mg/kg/day) and in combination (200 and 400 mg/kg/day) with levodopa/carbidopa. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits when istradefylline was administered in combination with levodopa/carbidopa was not identified. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose of istradefylline tested (50 mg/kg/day) in combination with levodopa/carbidopa is less than that in humans at the MRHD. Oral administration of istradefylline (0, 6, 25, 100, or 400 mg/kg/day) to female rats throughout gestation and lactation resulted in decreased pup survival and reduced pup body weight (which persisted into adulthood) at all but the lowest dose tested. Exposure to drug in the milk may have contributed to these effects, as demonstrated in pups of untreated (control) dams reared by dams receiving istradefylline (400 mg/kg/day). No adverse effects were observed on physical or neurobehavioral development, or reproductive function. Plasma exposure at the no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development in rats (6 mg/kg/day) is less than that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of istradefylline in human milk, the effects of istradefylline on the breastfed infant, or the effects of istradefylline on milk production. Istradefylline was present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations up to 10 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for NOURIANZ, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from NOURIANZ or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Use of NOURIANZ during pregnancy is not recommended. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use contraception during treatment with NOURIANZ [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No adjustment of NOURIANZ dosage is recommended on the basis of age. Of the total number of PD patients who received NOURIANZ in clinical trials, 53% were \u226565 years and 13% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No adjustment of NOURIANZ dosage is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (CrCL) by Cockcroft-Gault equation: 60-89 mL/min), moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-59 mL/min), or severe renal impairment (CrCL 15-29 mL/min). NOURIANZ has not been evaluated in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCL <15 mL/min) or ESRD requiring hemodialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No adjustment of NOURIANZ dosage is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the steady-state exposures (AUC 0-24h ) were predicted to be 3.3-fold higher than in healthy subjects, based on the estimated mean terminal half-life. Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage of NOURIANZ in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) is 20 mg once daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for adverse events when on NOURIANZ treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . NOURIANZ has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C ). Avoid use of NOURIANZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.8 Tobacco Smokers Tobacco smoking decreased NOURIANZ steady-state systemic exposures by 38% to 54% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may decrease efficacy. Therefore, the recommended NOURIANZ dosage in patients who smoke 20 or more cigarettes per day (or the equivalent amount of another tobacco product) is 40 mg once daily."], "pregnancy": ["8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of NOURIANZ in pregnant women. In animal studies ( see Data ), oral administration of istradefylline during pregnancy resulted in teratogenicity (increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, embryofetal and offspring mortality and growth deficits) at clinically relevant exposures and in the absence of maternal toxicity. The teratogenic effects of istradefylline in pregnant rabbits were substantially greater when administered in combination with levodopa/carbidopa than when administered alone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.

In in vitro studies and in in vivo animal studies, istradefylline was demonstrated to be an adenosine A 2A receptor antagonist. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of NOURIANZ (40 mg or 160 mg [4 times the maximum recommended dosage] once daily for 14 days) on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and moxifloxacin-controlled, multiple-dose, blinded, parallel group study. There was no clinically significant prolongation of QTc interval or relationship between changes in QTc and concentrations of istradefylline. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Istradefylline exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics after multiple oral doses from 20 mg to 80 mg (2 times the maximum recommended dosage). Steady-state was reached within 2 weeks of once-daily dosing. The pharmacokinetics of istradefylline were similar in PD patients and healthy subjects. Absorption The median time to reach the maximum concentration (T max ) for istradefylline was about 4 hours under fasted dosing conditions. Effect of Food Istradefylline exposure, represented by the area under the curve over time to infinity (AUC inf ), increased 1.25-fold when NOURIANZ was coadministered with a standard high-fat meal, compared with administration in a fasted state. Istradefylline maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) increased by 1.64-fold and T max was shortened by 1 hour when NOURIANZ was administered with a high-fat meal. These differences in pharmacokinetic parameters are not expected to be clinically significant [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Distribution The plasma protein binding of istradefylline was approximately 98%. The apparent volume of distribution (V d /F) of istradefylline is approximately 557 liters. Elimination The total clearance of istradefylline is approximately 4.6 L/hour. The mean terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for istradefylline at steady-state is approximately 83 hours. Metabolism In humans, istradefylline is exclusively eliminated via metabolism. In vitro studies indicate that istradefylline is primarily metabolized via CYP1A1 and CYP3A4, with minor contribution from CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, and 2D6. Six metabolites have been identified in human plasma. These metabolites each account for less than 10% of the exposure of the parent drug. Excretion Approximately 48% of a 40-mg oral dose of 14 C-istradefylline was eliminated in feces, and 39% in urine. Unchanged istradefylline was not detected in urine.

Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of istradefylline were observed based on age, sex, weight, or race. No clinically relevant changes in istradefylline exposure were observed in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL 15-29 mL/min) or mild hepatic impairment. NOURIANZ has not been studied in patients with ESRD (CrCL < 15 mL/min), ESRD patients requiring hemodialysis, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] .

The studies enrolled patients with a mean duration of Parkinson's disease of 9 years (range: 1 month to 37 years) that were Hoehn and Yahr Stage II to IV, experiencing at least 2 hours (mean approximately 6 hours) of \"off\" time per day, and were treated with levodopa for at least one year, with stable dosage for at least 4 weeks before screening (mean total daily dosage range: 416 to 785 mg). Patients continued levodopa treatment with or without concomitant PD medications, including dopamine agonists (85%), COMT inhibitors (38%), MAO-B inhibitors (40%), anticholinergics (13%), and/or amantadine (33%), provided the medications were stable for at least 4 weeks before screening and throughout the study period. The studies excluded patients who had received a neurosurgical treatment for PD (e.g., pallidotomy, thalamotomy, deep brain stimulation). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the daily awake percentage of \"off\" time, or the change from baseline in total daily \"off\" time, based on 24-hour diaries completed by patients.

Study 1 was conducted in the U.S. and Canada, and Study 2 was conducted in the U.S. In these studies, patients were randomized to once-daily treatment with NOURIANZ 20 mg, 40 mg, or placebo. Patients treated with NOURIANZ 20 mg or NOURIANZ 40 mg once daily experienced a statistically significant decrease from baseline in percentage of daily awake \"off\" time, compared with patients on placebo, as summarized in Table 2.

( 2.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric patients aged 4 to 11 years: 88 mcg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Administration Information Fluticasone Propionate HFA should be administered by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, rinse mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. A valved holding chamber and mask may be used to deliver Fluticasone Propionate HFA to young patients. Priming Prime Fluticasone Propionate HFA before using for the first time by releasing 4 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well for 5 seconds before each spray. In cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 7 days or when it has been dropped, prime the inhaler again by shaking well for 5 seconds and releasing 1 spray into the air away from the face. Avoid spraying in eyes. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Adult and Adolescent Patients Aged 12 Years and Older The recommended starting dosage for patients aged 12 years and older who are not on an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS): 88 mcg (2 inhalations of 44 mcg fluticasone propionate) twice daily by oral inhalation, approximately 12 hours apart. \u2022 The maximum recommended dosage for patients aged 12 years and older is 880 mcg twice daily.

General Dosing Recommendations The starting dosage is based on previous asthma therapy and asthma severity, including consideration of patients\u2019 current control of asthma symptoms and risk of future exacerbation. If symptoms arise between doses, an inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonist should be used for immediate relief. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. For other patients, and for patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dosage after 2 weeks of therapy, higher dosages may provide additional asthma control. If a dosage regimen fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options, e.g., replacing the current strength with a higher strength, initiating an ICS and long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA) combination product, or initiating oral corticosteroids, should be considered.

Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use Fluticasone Propionate HFA long term. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Oropharyngeal Candidiasis In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred in subjects treated with fluticasone propionate HFA. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with Fluticasone Propionate HFA continues, but at times therapy with Fluticasone Propionate HFA may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. 5.2 Acute Asthma Episodes Fluticasone Propionate HFA is not to be regarded as a bronchodilator and is not indicated for rapid relief of bronchospasm. Patients should be instructed to contact their physicians immediately when episodes of asthma that are not responsive to bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with Fluticasone Propionate HFA. During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids. 5.3 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. ICS should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. 5.4 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy HPA Suppression/Adrenal Insufficiency Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although Fluticasone Propionate HFA may control asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to Fluticasone Propionate HFA. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with Fluticasone Propionate HFA. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1 ] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension. Unmasking of Allergic Conditions Previously Suppressed by Systemic Corticosteroids Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to Fluticasone Propionate HFA may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). Corticosteroid Withdrawal Symptoms During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function. 5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression Fluticasone propionate will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since fluticasone propionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of Fluticasone Propionate HFA in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. A relationship between plasma levels of fluticasone propionate and inhibitory effects on stimulated cortisol production has been shown after 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing Fluticasone Propionate HFA. Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of ICS in sensitive patients, patients treated with Fluticasone Propionate HFA should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, Fluticasone Propionate HFA should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and other treatments for management of asthma symptoms should be considered. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of Fluticasone Propionate HFA [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.7 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing ICS. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids), should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. A 2-year trial in 160 subjects (females aged 18 to 40 years, males 18 to 50) with asthma receiving chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-propelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol 88 or 440 mcg twice daily demonstrated no statistically significant changes in BMD at any time point (24, 52, 76, and 104 weeks of double-blind treatment) as assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at lumbar regions L1 through L4. 5.8 Effect on Growth Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving Fluticasone Propionate HFA routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Fluticasone Propionate HFA, titrate each patient\u2019s dosage to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.9 Glaucoma and Cataracts Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients following the long-term administration of ICS, including fluticasone propionate. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use Fluticasone Propionate HFA long term. 5.10 Paradoxical Bronchospasm As with other inhaled medicines, bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing with Fluticasone Propionate HFA, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; Fluticasone Propionate HFA should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted. 5.11 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with Fluticasone Propionate HFA is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.12 Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome In rare cases, patients on inhaled fluticasone propionate may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other ICS in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established."], "adverse_reactions": ["6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Oropharyngeal candidiasis infection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Immunosuppression and risk of infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Reduction in bone mineral density [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Growth effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Glaucoma and cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >3%) are upper respiratory tract infection or inflammation, throat irritation, sinusitis, dysphonia, candidiasis, cough, bronchitis, and headache.

Less than 2% of subjects discontinued from the trials because of adverse reactions. The average duration of exposure was 73 to 76 days in the active treatment groups compared with 60 days in the placebo group. Additional Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions not previously listed, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, that were reported more frequently by subjects with asthma treated with fluticasone propionate HFA compared with subjects treated with placebo include the following: rhinitis, rhinorrhea/post-nasal drip, nasal sinus disorders, laryngitis, diarrhea, viral gastrointestinal infections, dyspeptic symptoms, gastrointestinal discomfort and pain, hyposalivation, musculoskeletal pain, muscle pain, muscle stiffness/tightness/rigidity, dizziness, migraines, fever, viral infections, pain, chest symptoms, viral skin infections, muscle injuries, soft tissue injuries, urinary infections. Fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol (440 or 880 mcg twice daily) was administered for 16 weeks to 168 subjects with asthma requiring oral corticosteroids (Trial 3). Adverse reactions not included above but reported by more than 3 subjects in either group treated with fluticasone propionate HFA and more commonly than in the placebo group included nausea and vomiting, arthralgia and articular rheumatism, and malaise and fatigue. In 2 long-term trials (26 and 52 weeks), the pattern of adverse reactions in subjects treated with fluticasone propionate HFA at dosages up to 440 mcg twice daily was similar to that observed in the 12-week trials. There were no new and/or unexpected adverse reactions with long-term treatment. Pediatric Subjects Aged 4 to 11 Years Fluticasone propionate HFA has been evaluated for safety in 56 pediatric subjects who received 88 mcg twice daily for 4 weeks. Types of adverse reactions in these pediatric subjects were generally similar to those observed in adults and adolescents. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of fluticasone propionate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to fluticasone propionate or a combination of these factors. Ear, Nose, and Throat Aphonia, facial and oropharyngeal edema, and throat soreness and irritation. Endocrine and Metabolic Cushingoid features, growth velocity reduction in children/adolescents, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and weight gain. Eye Cataracts.

The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with Fluticasone Propionate HFA is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur. Ritonavir A drug interaction trial with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression. Ketoconazole Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC), but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol."], "use_in_specific_populations": ["8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment: Monitor patients for signs of increased drug exposure. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient data on the use of fluticasone propionate HFA in pregnant women. There are clinical considerations with the use of fluticasone propionate HFA in pregnant women. (See Clinical Considerations.) In animals, teratogenicity characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight, and/or skeletal variations in rats, mice, and rabbits, was observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the maximum recommended human daily inhaled dose (MRHDID) on a mcg/m 2 basis. (See Data.) However, fluticasone propionate administered via inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis. (See Data.) Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk: In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women with asthma should be closely monitored and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal asthma control. Data Human Data: Following inhaled administration, fluticasone propionate was detected in the neonatal cord blood after delivery. Animal Data: In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 0.5 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). The rat no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was observed at approximately 0.17 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 0.1 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). The mouse NOAEL was observed with a dose approximately 0.04 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 0.14 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. The NOAEL was observed with a dose approximately 0.03 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at doses approximately 0.006 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at a dose approximately 0.04 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day). The NOAEL was observed in rabbit fetuses with a dose approximately 0.001 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day). Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to 0.3 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of fluticasone propionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. However, fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for fluticasone propionate HFA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fluticasone propionate HFA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data: Subcutaneous administration of tritiated fluticasone propionate at a dose of 10 mcg/kg/day to lactating rats resulted in measurable levels in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fluticasone propionate HFA in pediatric patients aged 4 years and older have been established [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Use of fluticasone propionate HFA in patients aged 4 to 11 years is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, pharmacokinetic trials in patients aged 4 to 11 years, established efficacy of fluticasone propionate formulated as FLOVENT DISKUS (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder) and FLOVENT ROTADISK (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder) in patients aged 4 to 11 years, and supportive findings with fluticasone propionate HFA in a trial conducted in subjects aged 4 to 11 years. The safety and effectiveness of fluticasone propionate HFA in pediatric patients younger than 4 years have not been established. Effects on Growth Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. A reduction of growth velocity in children or teenagers may occur as a result of poorly controlled asthma or from use of corticosteroids including ICS. The effects of long-term treatment of children and adolescents with ICS, including fluticasone propionate, on final adult height are not known. Controlled clinical trials have shown that ICS may cause a reduction in growth in pediatric patients. In these trials, the mean reduction in growth velocity was approximately 1 cm/year (range: 0.3 to 1.8 cm/year) and appeared to depend upon dose and duration of exposure. This effect was observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with orally inhaled corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth following discontinuation of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The effects on growth velocity of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids for over 1 year, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The growth of children and adolescents receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Fluticasone Propionate HFA, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks associated with alternative therapies. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Fluticasone Propionate HFA, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls his/her symptoms. Since a cross trial comparison in adult and adolescent subjects (aged 12 years and older) indicated that systemic exposure of inhaled fluticasone propionate from fluticasone propionate HFA would be higher than exposure from FLOVENT ROTADISK, results from a trial to assess the potential growth effects of FLOVENT ROTADISK in pediatric subjects (aged 4 to 11 years) are provided. A 52-week placebo-controlled trial to assess the potential growth effects of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (FLOVENT ROTADISK) at 50 and 100 mcg twice daily was conducted in the U.S. in 325 prepubescent children (244 males and 81 females) aged 4 to 11 years. The mean growth velocities at 52 weeks observed in the intent-to-treat population were 6.32 cm/year in the placebo group (n = 76), 6.07 cm/year in the 50-mcg group (n = 98), and 5.66 cm/year in the 100-mcg group (n = 89). An imbalance in the proportion of children entering puberty between groups and a higher dropout rate in the placebo group due to poorly controlled asthma may be confounding factors in interpreting these data. A separate subset analysis of children who remained prepubertal during the trial revealed growth rates at 52 weeks of 6.10 cm/year in the placebo group (n = 57), 5.91 cm/year in the 50-mcg group (n = 74), and 5.67 cm/year in the 100-mcg group (n = 79). In children aged 8.5 years, the mean age of children in this trial, the range for expected growth velocity is: boys \u2013 3rd percentile = 3.8 cm/year, 50th percentile = 5.4 cm/year, and 97th percentile = 7.0 cm/year; girls \u2013 3rd percentile = 4.2 cm/year, 50th percentile = 5.7 cm/year, and 97th percentile = 7.3 cm/year. The clinical relevance of these growth data is not certain. Pediatric Patients Younger than 4 Years Pharmacokinetics: [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Pharmacodynamics: A 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted in children with asthma aged 1 to younger than 4 years. Twelve-hour overnight urinary cortisol excretion after a 12-week treatment period with 88 mcg of fluticasone propionate HFA twice daily (n = 73) and with placebo (n = 42) were calculated. The mean and median change from baseline in urine cortisol over 12 hours were -0.7 and 0.0 mcg for fluticasone propionate HFA and 0.3 and -0.2 mcg for placebo, respectively. In a 1-way crossover trial in children aged 6 to younger than 12 months with reactive airways disease (N = 21), serum cortisol was measured over a 12-hour dosing period. Subjects received placebo treatment for a 2-week period followed by a 4-week treatment period with 88 mcg of fluticasone propionate HFA twice daily with an AeroChamber Plus Valved Holding Chamber (VHC) with mask. The geometric mean ratio of serum cortisol over 12 hours [AUC (0-12 h) ] following fluticasone propionate HFA (n = 16) versus placebo (n = 18) was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.27). Safety: Fluticasone propionate HFA administered as 88 mcg twice daily was evaluated for safety in 239 pediatric subjects aged 1 to younger than 4 years in a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Treatments were administered with an AeroChamber Plus VHC with mask. The following events occurred with a frequency >3% and more frequently in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate HFA than in subjects receiving placebo, regardless of causality assessment: pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, otitis media, diarrhea, bronchitis, pharyngitis, and viral infection. Fluticasone propionate HFA administered as 88 mcg twice daily was evaluated for safety in 23 pediatric subjects aged 6 to 12 months in an open-label placebo-controlled trial. Treatments were administered with an AeroChamber Plus VHC with mask for 2 weeks with placebo followed by 4 weeks with active drug. There was no discernable difference in the types of adverse events reported between subjects receiving placebo compared with the active drug. In Vitro Testing of Dose Delivery with Holding Chambers: In vitro dose characterization studies were performed to evaluate the delivery of fluticasone propionate HFA via holding chambers with attached masks. The studies were conducted with 2 different holding chambers (AeroChamber Plus VHC and AeroChamber Z-STAT Plus VHC) with masks (small and medium size) at inspiratory flow rates of 4.9, 8.0, and 12.0 L/min in combination with holding times of 0, 2, 5, and 10 seconds. The flow rates were selected to be representative of inspiratory flow rates of children aged 6 to 12 months, 2 to 5 years, and over 5 years, respectively. The mean delivered dose of fluticasone propionate through the holding chambers with masks was lower than the 44 mcg of fluticasone propionate delivered directly from the actuator mouthpiece. The results were similar through both holding chambers (see Table 2 for data for the AeroChamber Plus VHC). The fine particle fraction (approximately 1 to 5 \u03bcm) across the flow rates used in these studies was 70% to 84% of the delivered dose, consistent with the removal of the coarser fraction by the holding chamber. In contrast, the fine particle fraction for fluticasone propionate HFA delivered without a holding chamber typically represents 42% to 55% of the delivered dose measured at the standard flow rate of 28.3 L/min. These data suggest that, on a per kilogram basis, young children receive a comparable dose of fluticasone propionate when delivered via a holding chamber and mask as adults do without their use.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Formal pharmacokinetic studies using fluticasone propionate HFA have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Since fluticasone propionate is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. 8.7 Renal Impairment Formal pharmacokinetic studies using fluticasone propionate HFA have not been conducted in patients with renal impairment."], "use_in_specific_populations_table": ["<table width=\"100%\"><caption>Table 2.

insufficient data on the use of fluticasone propionate HFA in pregnant women. There are clinical considerations with the use of fluticasone propionate HFA in pregnant women. (See Clinical Considerations.) In animals, teratogenicity characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight, and/or skeletal variations in rats, mice, and rabbits, was observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the maximum recommended human daily inhaled dose (MRHDID) on a mcg/m 2 basis. (See Data.) However, fluticasone propionate administered via inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis. (See Data.) Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk: In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women with asthma should be closely monitored and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal asthma control. Data Human Data: Following inhaled administration, fluticasone propionate was detected in the neonatal cord blood after delivery. Animal Data: In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 0.5 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). The rat no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was observed at approximately 0.17 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 0.1 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). The mouse NOAEL was observed with a dose approximately 0.04 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 0.14 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. The NOAEL was observed with a dose approximately 0.03 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at doses approximately 0.006 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at a dose approximately 0.04 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day). The NOAEL was observed in rabbit fetuses with a dose approximately 0.001 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day). Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to 0.3 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day)."], "pediatric_use": ["8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fluticasone propionate HFA in pediatric patients aged 4 years and older have been established [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] .

To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Fluticasone Propionate HFA, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls his/her symptoms. Since a cross trial comparison in adult and adolescent subjects (aged 12 years and older) indicated that systemic exposure of inhaled fluticasone propionate from fluticasone propionate HFA would be higher than exposure from FLOVENT ROTADISK, results from a trial to assess the potential growth effects of FLOVENT ROTADISK in pediatric subjects (aged 4 to 11 years) are provided. A 52-week placebo-controlled trial to assess the potential growth effects of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (FLOVENT ROTADISK) at 50 and 100 mcg twice daily was conducted in the U.S. in 325 prepubescent children (244 males and 81 females) aged 4 to 11 years. The mean growth velocities at 52 weeks observed in the intent-to-treat population were 6.32 cm/year in the placebo group (n = 76), 6.07 cm/year in the 50-mcg group (n = 98), and 5.66 cm/year in the 100-mcg group (n = 89). An imbalance in the proportion of children entering puberty between groups and a higher dropout rate in the placebo group due to poorly controlled asthma may be confounding factors in interpreting these data. A separate subset analysis of children who remained prepubertal during the trial revealed growth rates at 52 weeks of 6.10 cm/year in the placebo group (n = 57), 5.91 cm/year in the 50-mcg group (n = 74), and 5.67 cm/year in the 100-mcg group (n = 79).

The clinical relevance of these growth data is not certain. Pediatric Patients Younger than 4 Years Pharmacokinetics: [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Pharmacodynamics: A 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted in children with asthma aged 1 to younger than 4 years. Twelve-hour overnight urinary cortisol excretion after a 12-week treatment period with 88 mcg of fluticasone propionate HFA twice daily (n = 73) and with placebo (n = 42) were calculated. The mean and median change from baseline in urine cortisol over 12 hours were -0.7 and 0.0 mcg for fluticasone propionate HFA and 0.3 and -0.2 mcg for placebo, respectively. In a 1-way crossover trial in children aged 6 to younger than 12 months with reactive airways disease (N = 21), serum cortisol was measured over a 12-hour dosing period. Subjects received placebo treatment for a 2-week period followed by a 4-week treatment period with 88 mcg of fluticasone propionate HFA twice daily with an AeroChamber Plus Valved Holding Chamber (VHC) with mask. The geometric mean ratio of serum cortisol over 12 hours [AUC (0-12 h) ] following fluticasone propionate HFA (n = 16) versus placebo (n = 18) was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.27). Safety: Fluticasone propionate HFA administered as 88 mcg twice daily was evaluated for safety in 239 pediatric subjects aged 1 to younger than 4 years in a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Treatments were administered with an AeroChamber Plus VHC with mask for 2 weeks with placebo followed by 4 weeks with active drug. There was no discernable difference in the types of adverse events reported between subjects receiving placebo compared with the active drug. In Vitro Testing of Dose Delivery with Holding Chambers: In vitro dose characterization studies were performed to evaluate the delivery of fluticasone propionate HFA via holding chambers with attached masks. The studies were conducted with 2 different holding chambers (AeroChamber Plus VHC and AeroChamber Z-STAT Plus VHC) with masks (small and medium size) at inspiratory flow rates of 4.9, 8.0, and 12.0 L/min in combination with holding times of 0, 2, 5, and 10 seconds. The flow rates were selected to be representative of inspiratory flow rates of children aged 6 to 12 months, 2 to 5 years, and over 5 years, respectively. The mean delivered dose of fluticasone propionate through the holding chambers with masks was lower than the 44 mcg of fluticasone propionate delivered directly from the actuator mouthpiece. The results were similar through both holding chambers (see Table 2 for data for the AeroChamber Plus VHC). The fine particle fraction (approximately 1 to 5 \u03bcm) across the flow rates used in these studies was 70% to 84% of the delivered dose, consistent with the removal of the coarser fraction by the holding chamber. In contrast, the fine particle fraction for fluticasone propionate HFA delivered without a holding chamber typically represents 42% to 55% of the delivered dose measured at the standard flow rate of 28.3 L/min. These data suggest that, on a per kilogram basis, young children receive a comparable dose of fluticasone propionate when delivered via a holding chamber and mask as adults do without their use.

The active component of Fluticasone Propionate HFA 44 mcg, Fluticasone Propionate HFA 110 mcg, and Fluticasone Propionate HFA 220 mcg is fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid having the chemical name S -(fluoromethyl) 6\u03b1,9-difluoro-11\u03b2,17-dihydroxy-16\u03b1-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17\u03b2-carbothioate, 17-propionate and the following chemical structure: Fluticasone propionate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 500.6, and the empirical formula is C 25 H 31 F 3 O 5 S. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide, and slightly soluble in methanol and 95% ethanol. Fluticasone Propionate HFA is a dark orange plastic inhaler with a peach cap containing a pressurized metered-dose aerosol canister fitted with a counter. Each canister contains a microcrystalline suspension of micronized fluticasone propionate in propellant HFA-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane). It contains no other excipients. After priming, each actuation of the inhaler delivers 50, 125, or 250 mcg of fluticasone propionate in 60 mg of suspension (for the 44-mcg product) or in 75 mg of suspension (for the 110- and 220-mcg products) from the valve. Each actuation delivers 44, 110, or 220 mcg of fluticasone propionate from the actuator. The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors, such as the coordination between the actuation of the inhaler and inspiration through the delivery system. Prime Fluticasone Propionate HFA before using for the first time by releasing 4 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well for 5 seconds before each spray. In cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 7 days or when it has been dropped, prime the inhaler again by shaking well for 5 seconds and releasing 1 spray into the air away from the face. Avoid spraying in eyes. Fluticasone propionate chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone\u201117\u2011monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer. Trials in subjects with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended doses of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, negligible oral systemic bioavailability (<1%), and the minimal pharmacological activity of the only metabolite detected in man. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Serum cortisol concentrations, urinary excretion of cortisol, and urine 6-\u03b2-hydroxycortisol excretion collected over 24 hours in 24 healthy subjects following 8 inhalations of fluticasone propionate HFA 44, 110, and 220 mcg decreased with increasing dose. However, in patients with asthma treated with 2 inhalations of fluticasone propionate HFA 44, 110, and 220 mcg twice daily for at least 4 weeks, differences in serum cortisol AUC (0-12 h) (n = 65) and 24-hour urinary excretion of cortisol (n = 47) compared with placebo were not related to dose and generally not significant. In the trial with healthy volunteers, the effect of propellant was also evaluated by comparing results following the 220-mcg strength inhaler containing HFA 134a propellant with the same strength of inhaler containing CFC 11/12 propellant. A lesser effect on the HPA axis with the HFA formulation was observed for serum cortisol, but not urine cortisol and 6-betahydroxy cortisol excretion. In addition, in a crossover trial in children with asthma aged 4 to 11 years (N = 40), 24-hour urinary excretion of cortisol was not affected after a 4-week treatment period with 88 mcg of fluticasone propionate HFA twice daily compared with urinary excretion after the 2-week placebo period. The ratio (95% CI) of urinary excretion of cortisol over 24 hours following fluticasone propionate HFA versus placebo was 0.987 (0.796, 1.223). The potential systemic effects of fluticasone propionate HFA on the HPA axis were also studied in subjects with asthma. Fluticasone propionate given by inhalation aerosol at dosages of 440 or 880 mcg twice daily was compared with placebo in oral corticosteroid-dependent subjects with asthma (range of mean dose of prednisone at baseline: 13 to 14 mg/day) in a 16-week trial. Consistent with maintenance treatment with oral corticosteroids, abnormal plasma cortisol responses to short cosyntropin stimulation (peak plasma cortisol <18 mcg/dL) were present at baseline in the majority of subjects participating in this trial (69% of subjects later randomized to placebo and 72% to 78% of subjects later randomized to fluticasone propionate HFA). At week 16, 8 subjects (73%) on placebo compared with 14 (54%) and 13 (68%) subjects receiving fluticasone propionate HFA (440 and 880 mcg twice daily, respectively) had post-stimulation cortisol levels of <18 mcg/dL. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluticasone propionate acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (<1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung is systemically absorbed. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averages 99%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. The total clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average, 1,093 mL/min), with renal clearance accounting for <0.02% of the total. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Metabolism: The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Specific Populations Male and Female Patients: No significant difference in clearance (CL/F) of fluticasone propionate was observed. Pediatric Patients: A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed for fluticasone propionate HFA using steady\u2011state data from 4 controlled clinical trials and single-dose data from 1 controlled clinical trial. The combined cohort for analysis included 269 subjects (161 males and 108 females) with asthma aged 6 months to 66 years who received treatment with fluticasone propionate HFA. Most of these subjects (n = 215) were treated with fluticasone propionate HFA 44 mcg given as 88 mcg twice daily. Fluticasone propionate HFA was delivered using an AeroChamber Plus VHC with a mask to subjects aged younger than 4 years. Data from adult subjects with asthma following fluticasone propionate HFA 110 mcg given as 220 mcg twice daily (n = 15) and following fluticasone propionate HFA 220 mcg given as 440 mcg twice daily (n = 17) at steady state were also included. Data for 22 subjects came from a single-dose crossover study of 264 mcg (6 doses of fluticasone propionate HFA 44 mcg) with and without AeroChamber Plus VHC in children with asthma aged 4 to 11 years. Stratification of exposure data following fluticasone propionate HFA 88 mcg by age and study indicated that systemic exposure to fluticasone propionate at steady state was similar in children aged 6 to younger than 12 months, children aged 1 to younger than 4 years, and adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. Exposure was lower in children aged 4 to 11 years, who did not use a VHC, as shown in Table 3 . Table 3. Systemic Exposure to Fluticasone Propionate following Fluticasone Propionate HFA 88 mcg Twice Daily Age Valved Holding Chamber N AUC (0-\u03c4), pg\u2022h/mL (95% CI) C max , pg/mL (95% CI) 6 to <12 Months Yes 17 141 (88, 227) 19 (13, 29) 1 to <4 Years Yes 164 143 (131, 157) 20 (18, 21) 4 to 11 Years No 14 68 (48, 97) 11 (8, 16) \u226512 Years No 20 149 (106, 210) 20 (15, 27) The lower exposure to fluticasone propionate in children aged 4 to 11 years who did not use a VHC may reflect the inability to coordinate actuation and inhalation of the metered-dose inhaler. The impact of the use of a VHC on exposure to fluticasone propionate in patients aged 4 to 11 years was evaluated in a single-dose crossover trial with fluticasone propionate HFA 44 mcg given as 264 mcg. In this trial, use of a VHC increased systemic exposure to fluticasone propionate ( Table 4 ), possibly correcting for the inability to coordinate actuation and inhalation. Table 4.

The AUC (0-\u03c4) in pg\u2022h/mL was 358 (95% CI: 272, 473) and 640 (95% CI: 477, 858), and C max in pg/mL was 47.3 (95% CI: 37, 61) and 87 (95% CI: 68, 112) following fluticasone propionate 220 and 440 mcg, respectively. Patients with Hepatic and Renal Impairment: Formal pharmacokinetic studies using fluticasone propionate HFA have not been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, since fluticasone propionate is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. Racial or Ethnic Groups: No significant difference in clearance (CL/F) of fluticasone propionate in Caucasian, African\u2011American, Asian, or Hispanic populations was observed. Drug Interaction Studies Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4: Ritonavir: Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC (0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC (0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range: 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole: In a placebo-controlled crossover trial in 8 healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of a single dose of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) with multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg) to steady state resulted in increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, a reduction in plasma cortisol AUC, and no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Following orally inhaled fluticasone propionate alone, AUC (2-last) averaged 1.559 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 0.555 to 2.906 ng\u2022h/mL) and AUC (2-\u221e) averaged 2.269 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 0.836 to 3.707 ng\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate AUC (2-last) and AUC (2-\u221e) increased to 2.781 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 2.489 to 8.486 ng\u2022h/mL) and 4.317 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 3.256 to 9.408 ng\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ketoconazole with orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This increase in plasma fluticasone propionate concentration resulted in a decrease (45%) in serum cortisol AUC.

Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone\u201117\u2011monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer. Trials in subjects with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended doses of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, negligible oral systemic bioavailability (<1%), and the minimal pharmacological activity of the only metabolite detected in man."], "pharmacodynamics": ["12.2 Pharmacodynamics Serum cortisol concentrations, urinary excretion of cortisol, and urine 6-\u03b2-hydroxycortisol excretion collected over 24 hours in 24 healthy subjects following 8 inhalations of fluticasone propionate HFA 44, 110, and 220 mcg decreased with increasing dose. However, in patients with asthma treated with 2 inhalations of fluticasone propionate HFA 44, 110, and 220 mcg twice daily for at least 4 weeks, differences in serum cortisol AUC (0-12 h) (n = 65) and 24-hour urinary excretion of cortisol (n = 47) compared with placebo were not related to dose and generally not significant. In the trial with healthy volunteers, the effect of propellant was also evaluated by comparing results following the 220-mcg strength inhaler containing HFA 134a propellant with the same strength of inhaler containing CFC 11/12 propellant. A lesser effect on the HPA axis with the HFA formulation was observed for serum cortisol, but not urine cortisol and 6-betahydroxy cortisol excretion. In addition, in a crossover trial in children with asthma aged 4 to 11 years (N = 40), 24-hour urinary excretion of cortisol was not affected after a 4-week treatment period with 88 mcg of fluticasone propionate HFA twice daily compared with urinary excretion after the 2-week placebo period. The ratio (95% CI) of urinary excretion of cortisol over 24 hours following fluticasone propionate HFA versus placebo was 0.987 (0.796, 1.223). The potential systemic effects of fluticasone propionate HFA on the HPA axis were also studied in subjects with asthma. Fluticasone propionate given by inhalation aerosol at dosages of 440 or 880 mcg twice daily was compared with placebo in oral corticosteroid-dependent subjects with asthma (range of mean dose of prednisone at baseline: 13 to 14 mg/day) in a 16-week trial. Consistent with maintenance treatment with oral corticosteroids, abnormal plasma cortisol responses to short cosyntropin stimulation (peak plasma cortisol <18 mcg/dL) were present at baseline in the majority of subjects participating in this trial (69% of subjects later randomized to placebo and 72% to 78% of subjects later randomized to fluticasone propionate HFA). At week 16, 8 subjects (73%) on placebo compared with 14 (54%) and 13 (68%) subjects receiving fluticasone propionate HFA (440 and 880 mcg twice daily, respectively) had post-stimulation cortisol levels of <18 mcg/dL."], "pharmacokinetics": ["12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluticasone propionate acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (<1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung is systemically absorbed. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averages 99%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. The total clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average, 1,093 mL/min), with renal clearance accounting for <0.02% of the total. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Metabolism: The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Specific Populations Male and Female Patients: No significant difference in clearance (CL/F) of fluticasone propionate was observed. Pediatric Patients: A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed for fluticasone propionate HFA using steady\u2011state data from 4 controlled clinical trials and single-dose data from 1 controlled clinical trial. The combined cohort for analysis included 269 subjects (161 males and 108 females) with asthma aged 6 months to 66 years who received treatment with fluticasone propionate HFA. Most of these subjects (n = 215) were treated with fluticasone propionate HFA 44 mcg given as 88 mcg twice daily. Fluticasone propionate HFA was delivered using an AeroChamber Plus VHC with a mask to subjects aged younger than 4 years. Data from adult subjects with asthma following fluticasone propionate HFA 110 mcg given as 220 mcg twice daily (n = 15) and following fluticasone propionate HFA 220 mcg given as 440 mcg twice daily (n = 17) at steady state were also included. Data for 22 subjects came from a single-dose crossover study of 264 mcg (6 doses of fluticasone propionate HFA 44 mcg) with and without AeroChamber Plus VHC in children with asthma aged 4 to 11 years. Stratification of exposure data following fluticasone propionate HFA 88 mcg by age and study indicated that systemic exposure to fluticasone propionate at steady state was similar in children aged 6 to younger than 12 months, children aged 1 to younger than 4 years, and adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. Exposure was lower in children aged 4 to 11 years, who did not use a VHC, as shown in Table 3 . Table 3. Systemic Exposure to Fluticasone Propionate following Fluticasone Propionate HFA 88 mcg Twice Daily Age Valved Holding Chamber N AUC (0-\u03c4), pg\u2022h/mL (95% CI) C max , pg/mL (95% CI) 6 to <12 Months Yes 17 141 (88, 227) 19 (13, 29) 1 to <4 Years Yes 164 143 (131, 157) 20 (18, 21) 4 to 11 Years No 14 68 (48, 97) 11 (8, 16) \u226512 Years No 20 149 (106, 210) 20 (15, 27) The lower exposure to fluticasone propionate in children aged 4 to 11 years who did not use a VHC may reflect the inability to coordinate actuation and inhalation of the metered-dose inhaler. The impact of the use of a VHC on exposure to fluticasone propionate in patients aged 4 to 11 years was evaluated in a single-dose crossover trial with fluticasone propionate HFA 44 mcg given as 264 mcg. In this trial, use of a VHC increased systemic exposure to fluticasone propionate ( Table 4 ), possibly correcting for the inability to coordinate actuation and inhalation. Table 4.

The AUC (0-\u03c4) in pg\u2022h/mL was 358 (95% CI: 272, 473) and 640 (95% CI: 477, 858), and C max in pg/mL was 47.3 (95% CI: 37, 61) and 87 (95% CI: 68, 112) following fluticasone propionate 220 and 440 mcg, respectively. Patients with Hepatic and Renal Impairment: Formal pharmacokinetic studies using fluticasone propionate HFA have not been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, since fluticasone propionate is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. Racial or Ethnic Groups: No significant difference in clearance (CL/F) of fluticasone propionate in Caucasian, African\u2011American, Asian, or Hispanic populations was observed. Drug Interaction Studies Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4: Ritonavir: Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC (0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC (0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range: 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole: In a placebo-controlled crossover trial in 8 healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of a single dose of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) with multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg) to steady state resulted in increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, a reduction in plasma cortisol AUC, and no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Following orally inhaled fluticasone propionate alone, AUC (2-last) averaged 1.559 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 0.555 to 2.906 ng\u2022h/mL) and AUC (2-\u221e) averaged 2.269 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 0.836 to 3.707 ng\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate AUC (2-last) and AUC (2-\u221e) increased to 2.781 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 2.489 to 8.486 ng\u2022h/mL) and 4.317 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 3.256 to 9.408 ng\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ketoconazole with orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This increase in plasma fluticasone propionate concentration resulted in a decrease (45%) in serum cortisol AUC. Erythromycin: In a multiple-dose drug interaction trial, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg 3 times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics."], "pharmacokinetics_table": ["<table width=\"99.02%\"><caption>Table 3.

Fixed dosages of 88, 220, and 440 mcg twice daily (each dose administered as 2 inhalations of the 44-, 110-, and 220-mcg strengths, respectively) and 880 mcg twice daily (administered as 4 inhalations of the 220-mcg strength) were compared with placebo to provide information about appropriate dosing to cover a range of asthma severity. Subjects in these trials included those inadequately controlled with bronchodilators alone (Trial 1), those already receiving ICS (Trial 2), and those requiring oral corticosteroid therapy (Trial 3). In all 3 trials, subjects were allowed to use VENTOLIN (albuterol, USP) Inhalation Aerosol as needed for relief of acute asthma symptoms. In Trials 1 and 2, other maintenance asthma therapies were discontinued. Trial 1 enrolled 397 subjects with asthma inadequately controlled on bronchodilators alone. Fluticasone propionate HFA was evaluated at dosages of 88, 220, and 440 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks. Baseline FEV 1 values were similar across groups (mean 67% of predicted normal). All 3 dosages of fluticasone propionate HFA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in lung function as measured by improvement in AM pre-dose FEV 1 compared with placebo. This improvement was observed after the first week of treatment and was maintained over the 12-week treatment period. At Endpoint (last observation), mean change from baseline in AM pre-dose percent predicted FEV 1 was greater in all 3 groups treated with fluticasone propionate HFA (9.0% to 11.2%) compared with the placebo group (3.4%). The mean differences between the groups treated with fluticasone propionate HFA 88, 220, and 440 mcg and the placebo group were statistically significant, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were (2.2%, 9.2%), (2.8%, 9.9%), and (4.3%, 11.3%), respectively. Figure 1 displays results of pulmonary function tests (mean percent change from baseline in FEV 1 prior to AM dose) for the recommended starting dosage of fluticasone propionate HFA (88 mcg twice daily) and placebo from Trial 1. This trial used predetermined criteria for lack of efficacy (indicators of worsening asthma), resulting in withdrawal of more subjects in the placebo group. Therefore, pulmonary function results at Endpoint (the last evaluable FEV 1 result, including most subjects\u2019 lung function data) are also displayed. Figure 1.

Baseline FEV 1 values were similar across groups (mean 65% to 66% of predicted normal). All 3 dosages of fluticasone propionate HFA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in lung function, as measured by improvement in FEV 1 , compared with placebo. This improvement was observed after the first week of treatment and was maintained over the 12-week treatment period. Discontinuations from the trial for lack of efficacy (defined by a pre-specified decrease in FEV 1 or PEF, or an increase in use of VENTOLIN or nighttime awakenings requiring treatment with VENTOLIN) were lower in the groups treated with fluticasone propionate HFA (6% to 11%) compared with placebo (50%). At Endpoint (last observation), mean change from baseline in AM pre-dose percent predicted FEV 1 was greater in all 3 groups treated with fluticasone propionate HFA (2.2% to 4.6%) compared with the placebo group (-8.3%). The mean differences between the groups treated with fluticasone propionate HFA 88, 220, and 440 mcg and the placebo group were statistically significant, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were (7.1%, 13.8%), (8.2%, 14.9%), and (9.6%, 16.4%), respectively. Figure 2 displays the mean percent change from baseline in FEV 1 from Week 1 through Week 12. This trial also used predetermined criteria for lack of efficacy, resulting in withdrawal of more subjects in the placebo group; therefore, pulmonary function results at Endpoint are also displayed. Figure 2. A 12-Week Clinical Trial in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Older Already Receiving Daily Inhaled Corticosteroids: Mean Percent Change from Baseline in FEV 1 Prior to AM Dose (Trial 2) In both trials, use of VENTOLIN, AM and PM PEF, and asthma symptom scores showed numerical improvement with fluticasone propionate HFA compared with placebo. Trial 3 enrolled 168 subjects with asthma requiring oral prednisone therapy (average baseline daily prednisone dose ranged from 13 to 14 mg). Fluticasone propionate HFA at dosages of 440 and 880 mcg twice daily was evaluated over a 16-week treatment period. Baseline FEV 1 values were similar across groups (mean 59% to 62% of predicted normal). Over the course of the trial, subjects treated with either dosage of fluticasone propionate HFA required a statistically significantly lower mean daily oral prednisone dose (6 mg) compared with placebo-treated subjects (15 mg). Both dosages of fluticasone propionate HFA enabled a larger percentage of subjects (59% and 56% in the groups treated with fluticasone propionate HFA 440 and 880 mcg, respectively, twice daily) to eliminate oral prednisone as compared with placebo (13%) (see Figure 3). There was no efficacy advantage of fluticasone propionate HFA 880 mcg twice daily compared with 440 mcg twice daily. Accompanying the reduction in oral corticosteroid use, subjects treated with either dosage of fluticasone propionate HFA had statistically significantly improved lung function, fewer asthma symptoms, and less use of VENTOLIN Inhalation Aerosol compared with the placebo-treated subjects. Figure 3. A 16-Week Clinical Trial in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Older Requiring Chronic Oral Prednisone Therapy: Change in Maintenance Prednisone Dose Two long-term safety trials (Trial 4 and Trial 5) of \u22656 months\u2019 duration were conducted in 507 adult and adolescent subjects with asthma. Trial 4 was designed to monitor the safety of 2 doses of fluticasone propionate HFA, while Trial 5 compared fluticasone propionate HFA with fluticasone propionate CFC. Trial 4 enrolled 182 subjects who were treated daily with low to high doses of ICS, beta-agonists (short-acting [as needed or regularly scheduled] or long-acting), theophylline, inhaled cromolyn or nedocromil sodium, leukotriene receptor antagonists, or 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors at baseline. Fluticasone propionate HFA at dosages of 220 and 440 mcg twice daily was evaluated over a 26-week treatment period in 89 and 93 subjects, respectively. Trial 5 enrolled 325 subjects who were treated daily with moderate to high doses of ICS, with or without concurrent use of salmeterol or albuterol, at baseline. Fluticasone propionate HFA at a dosage of 440 mcg twice daily and fluticasone propionate CFC at a dosage of 440 mcg twice daily were evaluated over a 52-week treatment period in 163 and 162 subjects, respectively. Baseline FEV 1 values were similar across groups (mean 81% to 84% of predicted normal). Throughout the 52-week treatment period, asthma control was maintained with both formulations of fluticasone propionate compared with baseline. In both trials, none of the subjects were withdrawn due to lack of efficacy. Figure 1.

Oropharyngeal Candidiasis Inform patients that localized infections with Candida albicans occurred in the mouth and pharynx in some patients. If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, treat it with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while still continuing therapy with Fluticasone Propionate HFA, but at times therapy with Fluticasone Propionate HFA may need to be temporarily interrupted under close medical supervision. Advise patients to rinse the mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation to help reduce the risk of thrush. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] Status Asthmaticus and Acute Asthma Symptoms Inform patients that Fluticasone Propionate HFA is not a bronchodilator and is not intended for use as rescue medicine for acute asthma exacerbations. Advise patients to treat acute asthma symptoms with an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist such as albuterol. Instruct patients to contact their physicians immediately if there is deterioration of their asthma. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).] Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Warn patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to consult their physicians without delay. Inform patients of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3).] Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression Advise patients that Fluticasone Propionate HFA may cause systemic corticosteroid effects of hypercorticism and adrenal suppression. Additionally, inform patients that deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids. Patients should taper slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to Fluticasone Propionate HFA. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5).] Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis Advise patients that immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of Fluticasone Propionate HFA. Patients should discontinue Fluticasone Propionate HFA if such reactions occur. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6).] Reduction in Bone Mineral Density Advise patients who are at an increased risk for decreased BMD that the use of corticosteroids may pose an additional risk. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7).] Reduced Growth Velocity Inform patients that orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Fluticasone Propionate HFA, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Physicians should closely follow the growth of children and adolescents taking corticosteroids by any route. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.8).] Glaucoma and Cataracts Advise patients that long-term use of ICS may increase the risk of some eye problems (cataracts or glaucoma); consider regular eye examinations. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9).] Use Daily for Best Effect Patients should use Fluticasone Propionate HFA at regular intervals as directed. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief and the full benefit may not be achieved until treatment has been administered for 1 to 2 weeks or longer. Patients should not increase the prescribed dosage but should contact their physicians if symptoms do not improve or if the condition worsens. Instruct patients not to stop use of Fluticasone Propionate HFA abruptly. Patients should contact their physicians immediately if they discontinue use of Fluticasone Propionate HFA.

( 2.1 ) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy Both the 1 mL vial and the 1 mL prefilled syringe of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term MPA Injectable Suspension, USP treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period; ONLY within the first 5-days postpartum if not breast-feeding; and if exclusively breast-feeding, ONLY at the sixth postpartum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching From Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."], "dosage_forms_and_strengths": ["3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Sterile Aqueous suspension: 150mg/ml Prefilled syringes are available packaged with 22-gauge \u00d7 1 1/2 inch Terumo\u00ae SurGuard\u2122 Needles.

( 5.2 ) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.4 ) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Liver Function: Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5.7 ) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with MPA. After discontinuing MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [See Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in women with osteoporosis risk factors. MPA Injectable Suspension, USP can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. However, MPA Injectable Suspension, USP has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer MPA Injectable Suspension, USP pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 2 . Figure 1 Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Figure 1 Cervical Cancer A statistically non-significant increase in RR estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, non-significant relative rate of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and MPA Injectable Suspension, USP causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer MPA Injectable Suspension, USP if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on MPA Injectable Suspension, USP treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. 5.13 Lactation Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. In nursing mothers treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, milk composition, quality, and amount are not adversely affected. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone from breast milk have been studied for developmental and behavioral effects through puberty. No adverse effects have been noted. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including MPA Injectable Suspension, USP may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued MPA Injectable Suspension, USP to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Patients should be counseled that MPA Injectable Suspension, USP does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 5.17 Pregnancy Although MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should not be used during pregnancy, there appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have inadvertently been exposed to MPA injections in early pregnancy. Neonates exposed to MPA in-utero and followed to adolescence showed no evidence of any adverse effects on their health including their physical, intellectual, sexual or social development. 5.18 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.19 Interference With Laboratory Tests The use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.

Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes.

Use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per MPA Injectable Suspension, USP user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD. Table 5.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between MPA Injectable Suspension, USP users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean=5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to MPA Injectable Suspension, USP use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in MPA Injectable Suspension, USP users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP has an effect on fracture rate later in life."], "clinical_studies_table": ["<table width=\"85%\" ID=\"t4\"><caption>Table 4.

The clinical significance of Peridex oral rinse's antimicrobial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54-97% through six months use. Use of Peridex in a six month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacteria resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after Peridex use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies with Peridex indicate approximately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rinsing. This retained drug is slowly released into the oral fluids. Studies conducted on human subjects and animals demonstrate chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0.206 mcg/g in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300-mg dose of the drug. Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered. Excretion of chlorhexidine gluconate occurred primarily through the feces (~90%). Less than 1% of the chlorhexidine gluconate ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine."], "pharmacokinetics": ["Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies with Peridex indicate approximately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rinsing.

Peridex has not been tested among patients with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG). For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, see PRECAUTIONS ."], "contraindications": ["CONTRAINDICATIONS Peridex should not be used by persons who are known to be hypersensitive to chlorhexidine gluconate or other formula ingredients."], "warnings": ["WARNINGS The effect of Peridex on periodontitis has not been determined. An increase in supragingival calculus was noted in clinical testing in Peridex users compared with control users. It is not known if Peridex use results in an increase in subgingival calculus. Calculus deposits should be removed by a dental prophylaxis at intervals not greater than six months. Anaphylaxis, as well as serious allergic reactions, have been reported during postmarketing use with dental products containing chlorhexidine. SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS ."], "precautions": ["PRECAUTIONS General For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, the presence or absence of gingival inflammation following treatment with Peridex should not be used as a major indicator of underlying periodontitis. Peridex can cause staining of oral surfaces, such as tooth surfaces, restorations, and the dorsum of the tongue. Not all patients will experience a visually significant increase in toothstaining. In clinical testing, 56% of Peridex users exhibited a measurable increase in facial anterior stain, compared to 35% of control users after six months; 15% of Peridex users developed what was judged to be heavy stain, compared to 1% of control users after six months. Stain will be more pronounced in patients who have heavier accumulations of unremoved plaque. Stain resulting from use of Peridex does not adversely affect health of the gingivae or other oral tissues. Stain can be removed from most tooth surfaces by conventional professional prophylactic techniques. Additional time may be required to complete the prophylaxis. Discretion should be used when prescribing to patients with anterior facial restorations with rough surfaces or margins. If natural stain cannot be removed from these surfaces by a dental prophylaxis, patients should be excluded from Peridex treatment if permanent discoloration is unacceptable. Stain in these areas may be difficult to remove by dental prophylaxis and on rare occasions may necessitate replacement of these restorations. Some patients may experience an alteration in taste perception while undergoing treatment with Peridex. Rare instances of permanent taste alteration following Peridex use have been reported via post-marketing product surveillance. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at chlorhexidine gluconate doses up to 300mg/kg/day and 40mg/kg/day, respectively, and have not revealed evidence of harm to fetus. However, adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not been done. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Peridex is administered to nursing women. In parturition and lactation studies with rats, no evidence of impaired parturition or of toxic effects to suckling pups was observed when chlorhexidine gluconate was administered to dams at doses that were over 100 times greater than that which would result from a person's ingesting 30ml (2 capfuls) of Peridex per day. Pediatric Use Clinical effectiveness and safety of Peridex have not been established in children under the age of 18. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a drinking water study in rats, carcinogenic effects were not observed at doses up to 38mg/kg/day. Mutagenic effects were not observed in two mammalian in vivo mutagenesis studies with chlorhexidine gluconate. The highest doses of chlorhexidine used in a mouse dominant-lethal assay and a hamster cytogenetics test were 1000mg/kg/day and 250mg/kg/day, respectively.

It should not be used in patients with nonbacterial infections such as most upper respiratory tract infections. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."], "description": ["DESCRIPTION Clindamycin Injection, USP in vials contains clindamycin phosphate, a water soluble ester of clindamycin and phosphoric acid. Each mL contains the equivalent of 150 mg clindamycin, 0.5 mg disodium edetate and 9.45 mg benzyl alcohol added as preservative in each mL. Clindamycin is a semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent compound lincomycin. The chemical name of clindamycin phosphate is L- threo -\u03b1-D- galacto- Octopyranoside, methyl-7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-[[(1-methyl-4-propyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)carbonyl] amino]-1-thio-, 2-(dihydrogen phosphate), (2 S-trans )-.

The structural formula is represented below: Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Distribution Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate is converted to active clindamycin. By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum concentrations of active clindamycin are reached. After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak concentrations of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum concentrations of clindamycin can be maintained above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose. No significant concentrations of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges. Metabolism In vitro studies in human liver and intestinal microsomes indicated that clindamycin is predominantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contribution from CYP3A5, to form clindamycin sulfoxide and a minor metabolite, N-desmethylclindamycin. Excretion Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears from the serum with 6 minutes of the average elimination half-life; however, the average serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2\u00bd hours in pediatric patients. Specific Populations Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61\u201379 years) and younger adults (18\u201339 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4\u20135.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1\u20134.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function 1 . Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients with PMA \u226432 weeks, or >32 to \u226440 weeks Systemic clearance (CL) in premature infants increases with increases in body weight (kg) and post-menstrual age (PMA). The dosing regimens for pediatric patients \u226432 weeks PMA (5 mg/kg) and >32 to \u226440 weeks PMA (7 mg/kg), both administered intravenously every 8 hours, achieve exposures comparable to therapeutic exposures in adults (weighing 70 kg) administered clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours (Table 1).

Microbiology Mechanism of Action Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic. Resistance Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test. Antimicrobial Activity Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ] : Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pyogenes Anaerobic bacteria Clostridium perfringens Fusobacterium necrophorum Fusobacterium nucleatum Peptostreptococcus anaerobius Prevotella melaninogenica The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for clindamycin against isolates of a similar genus or organism group.

Clindamycin phosphate products are also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, as described in the BOXED WARNING , before selecting clindamycin the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin). Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Clindamycin phosphate is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below: Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess caused by anaerobes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (except E. faecalis ), and Staphylococcus aureus. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus , and anaerobes. Gynecological infections including endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection caused by susceptible anaerobes. Intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms. Septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus , streptococci (except Enterococcus faecalis ), and susceptible anaerobes. Bone and joint infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate and other antibacterial drugs, clindamycin phosphate should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."], "contraindications": ["CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to preparations containing clindamycin or lincomycin."], "warnings": ["WARNINGS See BOXED WARNING . Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin phosphate, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Anaphylactic and Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic reactions have been reported ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), some with fatal outcome, have been reported ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . In case of such an anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue treatment permanently and institute appropriate therapy. A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity in Neonates (\"Gasping Syndrome\") This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The administration of intravenous solutions containing the preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with the \"gasping syndrome\", and death in neonates. Symptoms include a striking onset of gasping respiration, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although the normal therapeutic dose of this product delivers amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \"gasping syndrome\", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known and total daily benzyl alcohol exposure may be increased by concomitant medications. The risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity depends on the quantity administered and the liver and kidneys' capacity to detoxify the chemical. Premature and low birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Nephrotoxicity Clindamycin is potentially nephrotoxic and cases with acute kidney injury have been reported. Consider monitoring of renal function particularly in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or those taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. In case of acute kidney injury, discontinue clindamycin phosphate when no other etiology is identified. Usage in Meningitis Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, the drug should not be used in the treatment of meningitis."], "precautions": ["PRECAUTIONS General Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency. Clindamycin phosphate products should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Clindamycin phosphate should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals. Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy. The use of clindamycin phosphate may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms-particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation. Clindamycin phosphate should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 10\u201360 minutes as directed in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. Clindamycin dosage modification is not necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease. Prescribing clindamycin phosphate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including clindamycin phosphate should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clindamycin phosphate is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clindamycin phosphate or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests During prolonged therapy periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed. Drug Interactions Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents. Clindamycin is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, to the major metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide and minor metabolite N-desmethylclindamycin. Therefore, inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 may increase plasma concentrations of clindamycin and inducers of these isoenzymes may reduce plasma concentrations of clindamycin. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, monitor for loss of effectiveness. In vitro studies indicate that clindamycin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP2D6 and only moderately inhibits CYP3A4. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both tests were negative. Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 ) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters, has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities. Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. Clindamycin Injection contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol can cross the placenta (see WARNINGS ) . Nursing Mothers Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breast-fed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breast-fed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use When Clindamycin Injection is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . Usage in Newborns and Infants This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants (see WARNINGS ). The potential for the toxic effect in the pediatric population from chemicals that may leach from the single dose premixed IV preparation in plastic has not been evaluated (see WARNINGS ) . Geriatric Use Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibiotic-associated colitis and diarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficile ) seen in association with most antibiotics occur more frequently in the elderly (>60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young and elderly subjects with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration."], "general_precautions": ["General Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well.

Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents. Clindamycin is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, to the major metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide and minor metabolite N-desmethylclindamycin. Therefore, inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 may increase plasma concentrations of clindamycin and inducers of these isoenzymes may reduce plasma concentrations of clindamycin. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, monitor for loss of effectiveness. In vitro studies indicate that clindamycin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP2D6 and only moderately inhibits CYP3A4."], "carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility": ["Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential.

More severe infections, particularly those due to proven or suspected Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus species, or Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens : 1200\u20132700 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses. For more serious infections, these doses may have to be increased. In life-threatening situations due to either aerobes or anaerobes these doses may be increased. Doses of as much as 4800 mg daily have been given intravenously to adults (see Dilution for IV use and IV Infusion Rates section below). Single intramuscular injections of greater than 600 mg are not recommended. Alternatively, drug may be administered in the form of a single rapid infusion of the first dose followed by continuous IV infusion as follows: Table 2: Serum Clindamycin Levels Maintained, Rapid Infusion Rate and Maintenance Infusion Rate To maintain serum clindamycin levels Rapid infusion rate Maintenance infusion rate Above 4 mcg/mL 10 mg/min for 30 min 0.75 mg/min Above 5 mcg/mL 15 mg/min for 30 min 1.00 mg/min Above 6 mcg/mL 20 mg/min for 30 min 1.25 mg/min Pediatric Patients 1 month of age to 16 years Parenteral (IM or IV) Administration: 20 to 40 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equal doses. The higher doses would be used for more severe infections. Clindamycin should be dosed based on total body weight regardless of obesity. As an alternative to dosing on a body weight basis, pediatric patients may be dosed on the basis of square meters body surface: 350 mg/m 2 /day for serious infections and 450 mg/m 2 /day for more severe infections. Parenteral therapy may be changed to oral clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride granules or clindamycin hydrochloride capsules when the condition warrants and at the discretion of the physician. In cases of \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcal infections, treatment should be continued for at least 10 days. Pediatric Patients less than 1 month The recommended dosage is 15 to 20 mg/kg/day in 3 to 4 equal doses.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Dilution and Compatibility Physical and biological compatibility studies monitored for 24 hours at room temperature have demonstrated no inactivation or incompatibility with the use of clindamycin phosphate in IV solutions containing sodium chloride, glucose, calcium or potassium, and solutions containing vitamin B complex in concentrations usually used clinically. No incompatibility has been demonstrated with the antibiotics cephalothin, kanamycin, gentamicin, penicillin or carbenicillin. The following drugs are physically incompatible with clindamycin phosphate: ampicillin sodium, phenytoin sodium, barbiturates, aminophylline, calcium gluconate, and magnesium sulfate. The compatibility and duration of stability of drug admixtures will vary depending on concentration and other conditions.

Patients controlled with immediate\u2011release carvedilol tablets alone or in combination with other medications may be switched to COREG CR extended\u2011release capsules based on the total daily doses shown in Table 1 . Table 1. Dosing Conversion a When switching from carvedilol 12.5 mg or 25 mg twice daily, a starting dose of COREG CR 20 mg or 40 mg once daily, respectively, may be warranted for elderly patients or those at increased risk of hypotension, dizziness, or syncope. Subsequent titration to higher doses should, as appropriate, be made after an interval of at least 2 weeks. Daily Dose of Immediate-Release Carvedilol Tablets Daily Dose of COREG CR Capsules a 6.25 mg (3.125 mg twice daily) 10 mg once daily 12.5 mg (6.25 mg twice daily) 20 mg once daily 25 mg (12.5 mg twice daily) 40 mg once daily 50 mg (25 mg twice daily) 80 mg once daily COREG CR should be taken once daily in the morning with food. COREG CR should be swallowed as a whole capsule. COREG CR and/or its contents should not be crushed, chewed, or taken in divided doses. Alternative Administration The capsules may be carefully opened and the beads sprinkled over a spoonful of applesauce. The applesauce should not be warm because it could affect the modified-release properties of this formulation. The mixture of drug and applesauce should be consumed immediately in its entirety. The drug and applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Absorption of the beads sprinkled on other foods has not been tested. Take with food. Do not crush or chew capsules. Individualize dosage and monitor during up-titration. ( 2 ) \u2022 Heart failure: Start at 10 mg once daily and increase to 20, 40, and then 80 mg once daily over intervals of at least 2 weeks. Maintain lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction: Start at 20 mg once daily and increase to 40 mg then 80 mg once daily after intervals of 3 to 10 days. A lower starting dose or slower titration may be used. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Hypertension: Start at 20 mg once daily and increase if needed for blood pressure control to 40 mg then 80 mg once daily over intervals of 1 to 2 weeks. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Elderly patients (>65 years of age): When switching from higher doses of immediate-release carvedilol to COREG CR, a lower starting dose should be considered to reduce the risk of hypotension and syncope. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Heart Failure DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND CLOSELY MONITORED BY A PHYSICIAN DURING UP\u2011TITRATION. Prior to initiation of COREG CR, it is recommended that fluid retention be minimized. The recommended starting dose of COREG CR is 10 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Patients who tolerate a dose of 10 mg once daily may have their dose increased to 20, 40, and 80 mg over successive intervals of at least 2 weeks. Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. Patients should be advised that initiation of treatment and (to a lesser extent) dosage increases may be associated with transient symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness (and rarely syncope) within the first hour after dosing. Thus, during these periods, they should avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where symptoms could result in injury. Vasodilatory symptoms often do not require treatment, but it may be useful to separate the time of dosing of COREG CR from that of the ACE inhibitor or to reduce temporarily the dose of the ACE inhibitor. The dose of COREG CR should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure or vasodilation have been stabilized. Fluid retention (with or without transient worsening heart failure symptoms) should be treated by an increase in the dose of diuretics. The dose of COREG CR should be reduced if patients experience bradycardia (heart rate less than 55 beats per minute). Episodes of dizziness or fluid retention during initiation of COREG CR can generally be managed without discontinuation of treatment and do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, COREG CR. 2.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP\u2011TITRATION. Treatment with COREG CR may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that COREG CR be started at 20 mg once daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 40 mg once daily, then again to the target dose of 80 mg once daily. A lower starting dose may be used (10 mg once daily) and/or the rate of up\u2011titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral \u03b2\u2011blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction. 2.3 Hypertension DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The recommended starting dose of COREG CR is 20 mg once daily. If this dose is tolerated, using standing systolic pressure measured about 1 hour after dosing as a guide, the dose should be maintained for 7 to 14 days, and then increased to 40 mg once daily if needed, based on trough blood pressure, again using standing systolic pressure 1 hour after dosing as a guide for tolerance. This dose should also be maintained for 7 to 14 days and can then be adjusted upward to 80 mg once daily if tolerated and needed. Although not specifically studied, it is anticipated the full antihypertensive effect of COREG CR would be seen within 7 to 14 days as had been demonstrated with immediate\u2011release carvedilol. Total daily dose should not exceed 80 mg. Concomitant administration with a diuretic can be expected to produce additive effects and exaggerate the orthostatic component of carvedilol action. 2.4 Hepatic Impairment COREG CR should not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 2.5 Geriatric Use When switching elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) who are taking the higher doses of immediate-release carvedilol tablets (25 mg twice daily) to COREG CR, a lower starting dose (40 mg) of COREG CR is recommended to minimize the potential for dizziness, syncope, or hypotension [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Patients who have switched and who tolerate COREG CR should, as appropriate, have their dose increased after an interval of at least 2 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."], "dosage_and_administration_table": ["<table ID=\"_Ref54776512\" width=\"100%\"><caption>Table 1.

( 4 )"], "warnings_and_cautions": ["5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS In clinical trials of COREG CR in subjects with hypertension (338 subjects) and in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction following a myocardial infarction or heart failure (187 subjects), the profile of adverse events observed with carvedilol phosphate was generally similar to that observed with the administration of immediate\u2011release carvedilol. Therefore, the information included within this section is based on data from controlled clinical trials with COREG CR as well as immediate\u2011release carvedilol. \u2022 Acute exacerbation of coronary artery disease upon cessation of therapy: Do not abruptly discontinue. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Bradycardia, hypotension, worsening heart failure/fluid retention may occur. Reduce the dose as needed. ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) \u2022 Non-allergic bronchospasm (e.g., chronic bronchitis and emphysema): Avoid \u03b2\u2011blockers. ( 4 ) However, if deemed necessary, use with caution and at lowest effective dose. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Diabetes: Monitor glucose as \u03b2\u2011blockers may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia or worsen hyperglycemia. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cessation of Therapy Patients with coronary artery disease, who are being treated with COREG CR, should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with angina following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2\u2011blockers. The last 2 complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. As with other \u03b2\u2011blockers, when discontinuation of COREG CR is planned, the patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum. COREG CR should be discontinued over 1 to 2 weeks whenever possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that COREG CR be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue therapy with COREG CR abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension or heart failure. 5.2 Bradycardia In clinical trials with immediate\u2011release carvedilol, bradycardia was reported in about 2% of hypertensive subjects, 9% of subjects with heart failure, and 6.5% of subjects with myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction. Bradycardia was reported in 0.5% of subjects receiving COREG CR in a trial of subjects with heart failure and subjects with myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction. There were no reports of bradycardia in the clinical trial of COREG CR in hypertension. However, if pulse rate drops below 55 beats per minute, the dosage of COREG CR should be reduced. 5.3 Hypotension In clinical trials of primarily mild\u2011to\u2011moderate heart failure with immediate\u2011release carvedilol, hypotension and postural hypotension occurred in 9.7% and syncope in 3.4% of subjects receiving carvedilol compared with 3.6% and 2.5% of placebo subjects, respectively. The risk for these events was highest during the first 30 days of dosing, corresponding to the up\u2011titration period and was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.7% of carvedilol subjects, compared with 0.4% of placebo subjects. In a long\u2011term, placebo\u2011controlled trial in severe heart failure (COPERNICUS), hypotension and postural hypotension occurred in 15.1% and syncope in 2.9% of subjects with heart failure receiving carvedilol compared with 8.7% and 2.3% of placebo subjects, respectively. These events were a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 1.1% of carvedilol subjects, compared with 0.8% of placebo subjects. In a trial comparing subjects with heart failure switched to COREG CR or maintained on immediate-release carvedilol, there was a 2-fold increase in the combined incidence of hypotension, syncope, or dizziness in elderly subjects (older than 65 years) switched from the highest dose of carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) to COREG CR 80 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . In the clinical trial of COREG CR in hypertensive subjects, syncope was reported in 0.3% of subjects receiving COREG CR compared with 0% of subjects receiving placebo. There were no reports of postural hypotension in this trial. Postural hypotension occurred in 1.8% and syncope in 0.1% of hypertensive subjects receiving immediate\u2011release carvedilol, primarily following the initial dose or at the time of dose increase and was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 1% of subjects. In the CAPRICORN trial of survivors of an acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction, hypotension or postural hypotension occurred in 20.2% of subjects receiving carvedilol compared with 12.6% of placebo subjects. Syncope was reported in 3.9% and 1.9% of subjects, respectively. These events were a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 2.5% of subjects receiving carvedilol, compared with 0.2% of placebo subjects. Starting with a low dose, administration with food, and gradual up-titration should decrease the likelihood of syncope or excessive hypotension [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 )] . During initiation of therapy, the patient should be cautioned to avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where injury could result should syncope occur. 5.4 Heart Failure/Fluid Retention Worsening heart failure or fluid retention may occur during up\u2011titration of carvedilol. If such symptoms occur, diuretics should be increased, and the dose of COREG CR should not be advanced until clinical stability resumes [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Occasionally it is necessary to lower the dose of COREG CR or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, COREG CR. In a placebo\u2011controlled trial of subjects with severe heart failure, worsening heart failure during the first 3 months was reported to a similar degree with immediate-release carvedilol and with placebo. When treatment was maintained beyond 3 months, worsening heart failure was reported less frequently in subjects treated with carvedilol than with placebo. Worsening heart failure observed during long\u2011term therapy is more likely to be related to the patients\u2019 underlying disease than to treatment with carvedilol. 5.5 Non-allergic Bronchospasm Patients with bronchospastic disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) should, in general, not receive \u03b2\u2011blockers. COREG CR may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive agents. It is prudent, if COREG CR is used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous \u03b2\u2011agonists is minimized. In clinical trials of subjects with heart failure, subjects with bronchospastic disease were enrolled if they did not require oral or inhaled medication to treat their bronchospastic disease. In such patients, it is recommended that COREG CR be used with caution. The dosing recommendations should be followed closely, and the dose should be lowered if any evidence of bronchospasm is observed during up\u2011titration. 5.6 Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes In general, \u03b2\u2011blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2\u2011blockers may potentiate insulin\u2011induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents should be cautioned about these possibilities. In patients with heart failure and diabetes, carvedilol therapy may lead to worsening hyperglycemia, which responds to intensification of hypoglycemic therapy. It is recommended that blood glucose be monitored when dosing with COREG CR is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued. Trials designed to examine the effects of carvedilol on glycemic control in patients with diabetes and heart failure have not been conducted. In a trial designed to examine the effects of immediate\u2011release carvedilol on glycemic control in a population with mild\u2011to\u2011moderate hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, carvedilol had no adverse effect on glycemic control, based on HbA1c measurements [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )] . 5.7 Peripheral Vascular Disease \u03b2\u2011blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals. 5.8 Deterioration of Renal Function Rarely, use of carvedilol in patients with heart failure has resulted in deterioration of renal function. Patients at risk appear to be those with low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg), ischemic heart disease and diffuse vascular disease, and/or underlying renal insufficiency. Renal function has returned to baseline when carvedilol was stopped. In patients with these risk factors, it is recommended that renal function be monitored during up\u2011titration of COREG CR and the drug discontinued or dosage reduced if worsening of renal function occurs. 5.9 Major Surgery Chronically administered \u03b2-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. 5.10 Thyrotoxicosis \u03b2\u2011adrenergic blockade may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2\u2011blockade may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate thyroid storm. 5.11 Pheochromocytoma In patients with pheochromocytoma, an \u03b1\u2011blocking agent should be initiated prior to the use of any \u03b2\u2011blocking agent. Although carvedilol has both \u03b1\u2011 and \u03b2\u2011blocking pharmacologic activities, there has been no experience with its use in this condition. Therefore, caution should be taken in the administration of carvedilol to patients suspected of having pheochromocytoma. 5.12 Prinzmetal\u2019s Variant Angina Agents with non\u2011selective \u03b2\u2011blocking activity may provoke chest pain in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. There has been no clinical experience with carvedilol in these patients although the \u03b1\u2011blocking activity may prevent such symptoms. However, caution should be taken in the administration of COREG CR to patients suspected of having Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.13 Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction While taking \u03b2\u2011blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. 5.14 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha-1 blockers (COREG CR is an alpha/beta blocker). This variant of small pupil syndrome is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient\u2019s ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to the surgical technique, such as utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. There does not appear to be a benefit of stopping alpha-1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery."], "adverse_reactions": ["6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety profile of COREG CR was similar to that observed for immediate-release carvedilol. Most common adverse events seen with immediate-release carvedilol ( 6.1 ): \u2022 Heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction (\u226510%): Dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, asthenia, bradycardia, weight increase. \u2022 Hypertension (\u22655%): Dizziness. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Carvedilol has been evaluated for safety in subjects with heart failure (mild, moderate, and severe), in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction, and in hypertensive subjects. The observed adverse event profile was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the subjects in the clinical trials. Adverse events reported for each of these populations reflecting the use of either COREG CR or immediate-release carvedilol are provided below. Excluded are adverse events considered too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population. Rates of adverse events were generally similar across demographic subsets (men and women, elderly and non\u2011elderly, blacks and non\u2011blacks). COREG CR has been evaluated for safety in a 4-week (2 weeks of immediate-release carvedilol and 2 weeks of COREG CR) clinical trial (n = 187) which included 157 subjects with stable mild, moderate, or severe chronic heart failure and 30 subjects with left ventricular dysfunction following acute myocardial infarction. The profile of adverse events observed with COREG CR in this small, short-term trial was generally similar to that observed with immediate-release carvedilol. Differences in safety would not be expected based on the similarity in plasma levels for COREG CR and immediate-release carvedilol. Heart Failure The following information describes the safety experience in heart failure with immediate-release carvedilol. Carvedilol has been evaluated for safety in heart failure in more than 4,500 subjects worldwide of whom more than 2,100 participated in placebo\u2011controlled clinical trials. Approximately 60% of the total treated population in placebo\u2011controlled clinical trials received carvedilol for at least 6 months and 30% received carvedilol for at least 12 months. In the COMET trial, 1,511 subjects with mild\u2011to\u2011moderate heart failure were treated with carvedilol for up to 5.9 years (mean: 4.8 years). Both in U.S. clinical trials in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate heart failure that compared carvedilol in daily doses up to 100 mg (n = 765) with placebo (n = 437), and in a multinational clinical trial in severe heart failure (COPERNICUS) that compared carvedilol in daily doses up to 50 mg (n = 1,156) with placebo (n = 1,133), discontinuation rates for adverse experiences were similar in carvedilol and placebo subjects. In placebo\u2011controlled clinical trials, the only cause of discontinuation greater than 1% and occurring more often on carvedilol was dizziness (1.3% on carvedilol, 0.6% on placebo in the COPERNICUS trial). Table 2 shows adverse events reported in subjects with mild\u2011to\u2011moderate heart failure enrolled in U.S. placebo\u2011controlled clinical trials, and with severe heart failure enrolled in the COPERNICUS trial. Shown are adverse events that occurred more frequently in drug\u2011treated subjects than placebo\u2011treated subjects with an incidence of greater than 3% in subjects treated with carvedilol regardless of causality. Median trial medication exposure was 6.3 months for both carvedilol and placebo subjects in the trials of mild\u2011to\u2011moderate heart failure and 10.4 months in the trial of subjects with severe heart failure. The adverse event profile of carvedilol observed in the long-term COMET trial was generally similar to that observed in the U.S. Heart Failure Trials. Table 2.

Special Senses: Blurred vision. Urinary System: Renal insufficiency, albuminuria, hematuria. Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction The following information describes the safety experience in left ventricular dysfunction following acute myocardial infarction with immediate-release carvedilol. Carvedilol has been evaluated for safety in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction in the CAPRICORN trial which involved 969 subjects who received carvedilol and 980 who received placebo. Approximately 75% of the subjects received carvedilol for at least 6 months and 53% received carvedilol for at least 12 months. Subjects were treated for an average of 12.9 months and 12.8 months with carvedilol and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse events reported with carvedilol in the CAPRICORN trial were consistent with the profile of the drug in the U.S. heart failure trials and the COPERNICUS trial. The only additional adverse events reported in CAPRICORN in greater than 3% of the subjects and more commonly on carvedilol were dyspnea, anemia, and lung edema. The following adverse events were reported with a frequency of greater than 1% but less than or equal to 3% and more frequently with carvedilol: flu syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, peripheral vascular disorder, hypotonia, depression, gastrointestinal pain, arthritis, and gout. The overall rates of discontinuations due to adverse events were similar in both groups of subjects. In this database, the only cause of discontinuation greater than 1% and occurring more often on carvedilol was hypotension (1.5% on carvedilol, 0.2% on placebo). Hypertension COREG CR was evaluated for safety in an 8-week double-blind trial in 337 subjects with essential hypertension. The profile of adverse events observed with COREG CR was generally similar to that observed with immediate-release carvedilol. The overall rates of discontinuations due to adverse events were similar between COREG CR and placebo. Table 3. Adverse Events (%) Occurring More Frequently with COREG CR than with Placebo in Subjects with Hypertension (Incidence \u22651% in Subjects Treated with Carvedilol, Regardless of Causality) Adverse Event COREG CR (n = 253) Placebo (n = 84) Nasopharyngitis 4 0 Dizziness 2 1 Nausea 2 0 Edema peripheral 2 1 Nasal congestion 1 0 Paresthesia 1 0 Sinus congestion 1 0 Diarrhea 1 0 Insomnia 1 0 The following information describes the safety experience in hypertension with immediate-release carvedilol. Carvedilol has been evaluated for safety in hypertension in more than 2,193 subjects in U.S. clinical trials and in 2,976 subjects in international clinical trials. Approximately 36% of the total treated population received carvedilol for at least 6 months. In general, carvedilol was well tolerated at doses up to 50 mg daily. Most adverse events reported during carvedilol therapy were of mild to moderate severity. In U.S. controlled clinical trials directly comparing carvedilol monotherapy in doses up to 50 mg (n = 1,142) with placebo (n = 462), 4.9% of carvedilol subjects discontinued for adverse events versus 5.2% of placebo subjects. Although there was no overall difference in discontinuation rates, discontinuations were more common in the carvedilol group for postural hypotension (1% versus 0). The overall incidence of adverse events in U.S. placebo\u2011controlled trials was found to increase with increasing dose of carvedilol. For individual adverse events this could only be distinguished for dizziness, which increased in frequency from 2% to 5% as total daily dose increased from 6.25 mg to 50 mg as single or divided doses. Table 4 shows adverse events in U.S. placebo\u2011controlled clinical trials for hypertension that occurred with an incidence of greater than or equal to 1% regardless of causality and that were more frequent in drug\u2011treated subjects than placebo\u2011treated subjects.

The following events were reported in less than or equal to 0.1% of subjects and are potentially important: complete AV block, bundle branch block, myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular disorder, convulsions, migraine, neuralgia, paresis, anaphylactoid reaction, alopecia, exfoliative dermatitis, amnesia, GI hemorrhage, bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, decreased hearing, respiratory alkalosis, increased BUN, decreased HDL, pancytopenia, and atypical lymphocytes. Laboratory Abnormalities Reversible elevations in serum transaminases (ALT or AST) have been observed during treatment with carvedilol. Rates of transaminase elevations (2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal) observed during controlled clinical trials have generally been similar between subjects treated with carvedilol and those treated with placebo. However, transaminase elevations, confirmed by rechallenge, have been observed with carvedilol. In a long-term, placebo-controlled trial in severe heart failure, subjects treated with carvedilol had lower values for hepatic transaminases than subjects treated with placebo, possibly because carvedilol-induced improvements in cardiac function led to less hepatic congestion and/or improved hepatic blood flow. Carvedilol therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in serum potassium, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine. No clinically relevant changes were noted in fasting serum glucose in hypertensive subjects; fasting serum glucose was not evaluated in the heart failure clinical trials. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of COREG or COREG CR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Aplastic anemia. Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, urticaria). Renal and Urinary Disorders Urinary incontinence.

( 7.1 , 7.5 ) \u2022 Hypotensive agents (e.g., reserpine, MAO inhibitors, clonidine) may increase the risk of hypotension and/or severe bradycardia. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Cyclosporine or digoxin levels may increase. ( 7.3 , 7.4 ) \u2022 Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. ( 7.4 ) \u2022 Amiodarone may increase carvedilol levels resulting in further slowing of the heart rate or cardiac conduction. ( 7.6 ) \u2022 Verapamil- or diltiazem-type calcium channel blockers may affect ECG and/or blood pressure. ( 7.7 ) \u2022 Insulin and oral hypoglycemics action may be enhanced. ( 7.8 ) 7.1 CYP2D6 Inhibitors and Poor Metabolizers Interactions of carvedilol with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 isoenzyme (such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of carvedilol [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Retrospective analysis of side effects in clinical trials showed that poor 2D6 metabolizers had a higher rate of dizziness during up-titration, presumably resulting from vasodilating effects of the higher concentrations of the \u03b1\u2011blocking R(+) enantiomer. 7.2 Hypotensive Agents Patients taking a \u03b2\u2011blocker and a drug that can deplete catecholamines (e.g., reserpine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should be observed closely for signs of hypotension and/or severe bradycardia. Concomitant administration of clonidine with a \u03b2\u2011blocker may cause hypotension and bradycardia. When concomitant treatment with a \u03b2\u2011blocker and clonidine is to be terminated, the \u03b2\u2011blocker should be discontinued first. Clonidine therapy can then be discontinued several days later by gradually decreasing the dosage. 7.3 Cyclosporine Modest increases in mean trough cyclosporine concentrations were observed following initiation of carvedilol treatment in 21 renal transplant subjects suffering from chronic vascular rejection. In about 30% of subjects, the dose of cyclosporine had to be reduced in order to maintain cyclosporine concentrations within the therapeutic range, while in the remainder no adjustment was needed. On the average for the group, the dose of cyclosporine was reduced about 20% in these subjects. Due to wide interindividual variability in the dose adjustment required, it is recommended that cyclosporine concentrations be monitored closely after initiation of carvedilol therapy and that the dose of cyclosporine be adjusted as appropriate. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2\u2011blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Digoxin concentrations are increased by about 15% when digoxin and carvedilol are administered concomitantly. Therefore, increased monitoring of digoxin is recommended when initiating, adjusting, or discontinuing COREG CR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . 7.5 Inducers/Inhibitors of Hepatic Metabolism Rifampin reduced plasma concentrations of carvedilol by about 70% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Cimetidine increased area under the curve (AUC) by about 30% but caused no change in C max [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . 7.6 Amiodarone Amiodarone and its metabolite desethyl amiodarone, inhibitors of CYP2C9, and P-glycoprotein increased concentrations of the S(-) enantiomer of carvedilol by at least 2-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . The concomitant administration of amiodarone or other CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole with COREG CR may enhance the \u03b2\u2011blocking activity, resulting in further slowing of the heart rate or cardiac conduction. Patients should be observed for signs of bradycardia or heart block, particularly when one agent is added to pre-existing treatment with the other. 7.7 Calcium Channel Blockers Conduction disturbance (rarely with hemodynamic compromise) has been observed when COREG CR is coadministered with diltiazem. As with other \u03b2\u2011blockers, if COREG CR is administered with calcium channel blockers of the verapamil or diltiazem type, it is recommended that ECG and blood pressure be monitored. 7.8 Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics \u03b2\u2011blockers properties may enhance the blood\u2011sugar\u2011reducing effect of insulin and oral hypoglycemics. Therefore, in patients taking insulin or oral hypoglycemics, regular monitoring of blood glucose is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . 7.9 Proton Pump Inhibitors There is no clinically meaningful increase in AUC and C max with concomitant administration of carvedilol extended\u2011release capsules with pantoprazole. 7.10 Anesthesia If treatment with COREG CR is to be continued perioperatively, particular care should be taken when anesthetic agents that depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used [see Overdosage ( 10 )] ."], "use_in_specific_populations": ["8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS [Enter highlight text here] 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data regarding use of COREG CR in pregnant women are insufficient to determine whether there are drug-associated risks of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy. The use of beta blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression in the neonate (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at clinically relevant doses (see Data) . Oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in post-implantation loss, decreased fetal body weight, and an increased frequency of delayed fetal skeletal development at maternally toxic doses that were 50 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). In addition, oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in increased post-implantation loss at doses 25 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions: Neonates of women with hypertension who are treated with beta-blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may be at increased risk for hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression. Observe newborns for symptoms of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression and manage accordingly. Data Animal Data: Studies performed in rats and rabbits given carvedilol during fetal organogenesis revealed increased post\u2011implantation loss in rats at a maternally toxic dose of 300 mg per kg per day (50 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ) and in rabbits (in the absence of maternal toxicity) at doses of 75 mg per kg per day (25 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ). In the rats, there was also a decrease in fetal body weight at 300 mg per kg per day (50 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ) accompanied by an increased incidence of fetuses with delayed skeletal development. In rats, the no-effect level for embryo-fetal toxicity was 60 mg per kg per day (10 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ); in rabbits, it was 15 mg per kg per day (5 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ). In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats administered carvedilol from late gestation through lactation, increased embryo-lethality was observed at a maternally toxic dose of 200 mg per kg per day (approximately 32 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ), and pup mortality and delays in physical growth/development were observed at 60 mg per kg per day (10 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ) in the absence of maternal toxicity. The no-effect level was 12 mg per kg per day (2 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ). Carvedilol was present in fetal rat tissue. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of carvedilol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Carvedilol is present in the milk of lactating rats . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for COREG CR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from COREG CR or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Effectiveness of carvedilol in patients younger than 18 years has not been established. In a double-blind trial, 161 children (mean age: 6 years; range: 2 months to 17 years; 45% younger than 2 years) with chronic heart failure [NYHA class II-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% for children with a systemic left ventricle (LV), and moderate-severe ventricular dysfunction qualitatively by echo for those with a systemic ventricle that was not an LV] who were receiving standard background treatment were randomized to placebo or to 2 dose levels of carvedilol. These dose levels produced placebo-corrected heart rate reduction of 4 to 6 heart beats per minute, indicative of \u03b2-blockade activity. Exposure appeared to be lower in pediatric subjects than adults. After 8 months of follow-up, there was no significant effect of treatment on clinical outcomes. Adverse reactions in this trial that occurred in greater than 10% of subjects treated with immediate-release carvedilol and at twice the rate of placebo-treated subjects included chest pain (17% versus 6%), dizziness (13% versus 2%), and dyspnea (11% versus 0%). 8.5 Geriatric Use The initial clinical trials of COREG CR in subjects with hypertension, heart failure, and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years or older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. A randomized trial (n = 405) comparing subjects with mild to severe heart failure switched to COREG CR or maintained on immediate-release carvedilol included 220 subjects who were aged 65 years or older. In this elderly subgroup, the combined incidence of dizziness, hypotension, or syncope was 24% (18/75) in subjects switched from the highest dose of immediate-release carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) to the highest dose of COREG CR (80 mg once daily) compared with 11% (4/36) in subjects maintained on immediate-release carvedilol (25 mg twice daily). When switching from the higher doses of immediate-release carvedilol to COREG CR, a lower starting dose is recommended for elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . The following information is available for trials with immediate-release carvedilol. Of the 765 subjects with heart failure randomized to carvedilol in U.S. clinical trials, 31% (235) were aged 65 years or older, and 7.3% (56) were aged 75 years or older. Of the 1,156 subjects randomized to carvedilol in a long\u2011term, placebo\u2011controlled trial in severe heart failure, 47% (547) were aged 65 years or older, and 15% (174) were aged 75 years or older. Of 3,025 subjects receiving carvedilol in heart failure trials worldwide, 42% were aged 65 years or older. Of the 975 subjects with myocardial infarction randomized to carvedilol in the CAPRICORN trial, 48% (468) were aged 65 years or older, and 11% (111) were aged 75 years or older. Of the 2,065 hypertensive subjects in U.S. clinical trials of efficacy or safety who were treated with carvedilol, 21% (436) were aged 65 years or older. Of 3,722 subjects receiving immediate-release carvedilol in hypertension clinical trials conducted worldwide, 24% were aged 65 years or older. With the exception of dizziness in hypertensive subjects (incidence 8.8% in the elderly versus 6% in younger subjects), no overall differences in the safety or effectiveness (see Figures 2 and 4) were observed between the older subjects and younger subjects in each of these populations.

The following agents may be administered: For excessive bradycardia: Atropine, 2 mg IV. To support cardiovascular function: Glucagon, 5 to 10 mg IV rapidly over 30 seconds, followed by a continuous infusion of 5 mg per hour; sympathomimetics (dobutamine, isoprenaline, adrenaline) at doses according to body weight and effect.

It is a racemic mixture with the following structure: Carvedilol phosphate is a white-to-almost white solid with a molecular weight of 513.5 (406.5 carvedilol free base) and a molecular formula of C 24 H 26 N 2 O 4 \u2022H 3 PO 4 \u20221/2 H 2 O.

Inactive ingredients include crospovidone, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymers, microcrystalline cellulose, and povidone. carvedilol phosphate chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Carvedilol is a racemic mixture in which nonselective \u03b2\u2011adrenoreceptor blocking activity is present in the S(-) enantiomer and \u03b1 1 \u2011adrenergic blocking activity is present in both R(+) and S(-) enantiomers at equal potency. Carvedilol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Heart Failure and Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction The basis for the beneficial effects of carvedilol in patients with heart failure and in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following an acute myocardial infarction is not known. The concentration-response relationship for \u03b2 1 \u2011blockade following administration of COREG CR is equivalent (\u00b120%) to immediate-release carvedilol tablets. Hypertension The mechanism by which \u03b2\u2011blockade produces an antihypertensive effect has not been established. \u03b2\u2011adrenoreceptor blocking activity has been demonstrated in animal and human studies showing that carvedilol (1) reduces cardiac output in normal subjects, (2) reduces exercise- and/or isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (3) reduces reflex orthostatic tachycardia. Significant \u03b2\u2011adrenoreceptor blocking effect is usually seen within 1 hour of drug administration. \u03b1 1 \u2011adrenoreceptor blocking activity has been demonstrated in human and animal studies, showing that carvedilol (1) attenuates the pressor effects of phenylephrine, (2) causes vasodilation, and (3) reduces peripheral vascular resistance. These effects contribute to the reduction of blood pressure and usually are seen within 30 minutes of drug administration. Due to the \u03b1 1 \u2011receptor blocking activity of carvedilol, blood pressure is lowered more in the standing than in the supine position, and symptoms of postural hypotension (1.8%), including rare instances of syncope, can occur. Following oral administration, when postural hypotension has occurred, it has been transient and is uncommon when immediate-release carvedilol is administered with food at the recommended starting dose and titration increments are closely followed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the \u03b2 1 \u2011blocking effect of COREG CR, as measured by heart rate response to submaximal bicycle ergometry, was shown to be equivalent to that observed with immediate-release carvedilol at steady state in adult subjects with essential hypertension. In hypertensive subjects with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of carvedilol decreased renal vascular resistance with no change in glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow. Changes in excretion of sodium, potassium, uric acid, and phosphorus in hypertensive patients with normal renal function were similar after carvedilol and placebo. Carvedilol has little effect on plasma catecholamines, plasma aldosterone, or electrolyte levels, but it does significantly reduce plasma renin activity when given for at least 4 weeks. It also increases levels of atrial natriuretic peptide. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Carvedilol is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration of immediate-release carvedilol tablets, with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 25% to 35% due to a significant degree of first-pass metabolism. COREG CR extended-release capsules have approximately 85% of the bioavailability of immediate-release carvedilol tablets. For corresponding dosages [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] , the exposure (AUC, C max , trough concentration) of carvedilol as COREG CR extended-release capsules is equivalent to those of immediate-release carvedilol tablets when both are administered with food. The absorption of carvedilol from COREG CR is slower and more prolonged compared with the immediate-release carvedilol tablet with peak concentrations achieved approximately 5 hours after administration. Plasma concentrations of carvedilol increase in a dose-proportional manner over the dosage range of COREG CR 10 to 80 mg. Within-subject and between-subject variability for AUC and C max is similar for COREG CR and immediate-release carvedilol. Effect of Food: Administration of COREG CR with a high-fat meal resulted in increases (~20%) in AUC and C max compared with COREG CR administered with a standard meal. Decreases in AUC (27%) and C max (43%) were observed when COREG CR was administered in the fasted state compared with administration after a standard meal. COREG CR should be taken with food. In a trial with adult subjects, sprinkling the contents of the COREG CR capsule on applesauce did not appear to have a significant effect on overall exposure (AUC) compared with administration of the intact capsule following a standard meal, but did result in a decrease in C max (18%). Distribution Carvedilol is more than 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily with albumin. The plasma-protein binding is independent of concentration over the therapeutic range. Carvedilol is a basic, lipophilic compound with a steady-state volume of distribution of approximately 115 L, indicating substantial distribution into extravascular tissues. Metabolism and Excretion Carvedilol is extensively metabolized. Following oral administration of radiolabelled carvedilol to healthy volunteers, carvedilol accounted for only about 7% of the total radioactivity in plasma as measured by AUC. Less than 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Carvedilol is metabolized primarily by aromatic ring oxidation and glucuronidation. The oxidative metabolites are further metabolized by conjugation via glucuronidation and sulfation. The metabolites of carvedilol are excreted primarily via the bile into the feces. Demethylation and hydroxylation at the phenol ring produce 3 active metabolites with \u03b2\u2011receptor blocking activity. Based on preclinical studies, the 4'-hydroxyphenyl metabolite is approximately 13 times more potent than carvedilol for \u03b2\u2011blockade. Compared with carvedilol, the 3 active metabolites exhibit weak vasodilating activity. Plasma concentrations of the active metabolites are about one-tenth of those observed for carvedilol and have pharmacokinetics similar to the parent. Carvedilol undergoes stereoselective first-pass metabolism with plasma levels of R(+)-carvedilol approximately 2 to 3 times higher than S(-)-carvedilol following oral administration of COREG CR in healthy subjects. Apparent clearance is 90 L per h and 213 L per h for R(+)- and S(-)-carvedilol, respectively. The primary P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolism of both R(+) and S(-)-carvedilol in human liver microsomes were CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, 2C19, 1A2, and 2E1. CYP2D6 is thought to be the major enzyme in the 4\u2019- and 5\u2019-hydroxylation of carvedilol, with a potential contribution from 3A4. CYP2C9 is thought to be of primary importance in the O-methylation pathway of S(-)-carvedilol. Carvedilol is subject to the effects of genetic polymorphism with poor metabolizers of debrisoquin (a marker for cytochrome P450 2D6) exhibiting 2- to 3-fold higher plasma concentrations of R(+)-carvedilol compared with extensive metabolizers. In contrast, plasma levels of S(-)-carvedilol are increased only about 20% to 25% in poor metabolizers, indicating this enantiomer is metabolized to a lesser extent by cytochrome P450 2D6 than R(+)-carvedilol. The pharmacokinetics of carvedilol do not appear to be different in poor metabolizers of S-mephenytoin (patients deficient in cytochrome P450 2C19). Specific Populations Heart Failure: Following administration of immediate-release carvedilol tablets, steady\u2011state plasma concentrations of carvedilol and its enantiomers increased proportionally over the dose range in subjects with heart failure. Compared with healthy subjects, subjects with heart failure had increased mean AUC and C max values for carvedilol and its enantiomers, with up to 50% to 100% higher values observed in 6 subjects with NYHA class IV heart failure. The mean apparent terminal elimination half\u2011life for carvedilol was similar to that observed in healthy subjects. For corresponding dose levels [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] , the steady-state pharmacokinetics of carvedilol (AUC, C max , trough concentrations) observed after administration of COREG CR to subjects with chronic heart failure (mild, moderate, and severe) were similar to those observed after administration of immediate-release carvedilol tablets. Hypertension: For corresponding dose levels [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] , the pharmacokinetics (AUC, C max , and trough concentrations) observed with administration of COREG CR were equivalent (\u00b120%) to those observed with immediate-release carvedilol tablets following repeat dosing in subjects with essential hypertension. Geriatric: Plasma levels of carvedilol average about 50% higher in the elderly compared with young subjects after administration of immediate-release carvedilol. Hepatic Impairment: No trials have been performed with COREG CR in subjects with hepatic impairment. Compared with healthy subjects, subjects with severe liver impairment (cirrhosis) exhibit a 4\u2011 to 7\u2011fold increase in carvedilol levels. Carvedilol is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment. Renal Impairment: No trials have been performed with COREG CR in subjects with renal impairment. Although carvedilol is metabolized primarily by the liver, plasma concentrations of carvedilol have been reported to be increased in patients with renal impairment after dosing with immediate-release carvedilol. Based on mean AUC data, approximately 40% to 50% higher plasma concentrations of carvedilol were observed in subjects with hypertension and moderate to severe renal impairment compared with a control group of subjects with hypertension and normal renal function. However, the ranges of AUC values were similar for both groups. Changes in mean peak plasma levels were less pronounced, approximately 12% to 26% higher in subjects with impaired renal function. Consistent with its high degree of plasma protein binding, carvedilol does not appear to be cleared significantly by hemodialysis. Drug-Drug Interactions Since carvedilol undergoes substantial oxidative metabolism, the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of carvedilol may be affected by induction or inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes. The following drug interaction trials were performed with immediate-release carvedilol tablets. Amiodarone: In a pharmacokinetic trial conducted in 106 Japanese subjects with heart failure, coadministration of small loading and maintenance doses of amiodarone with carvedilol resulted in at least a 2-fold increase in the steady-state trough concentrations of S(-)-carvedilol [see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )] . Cimetidine: In a pharmacokinetic trial conducted in 10 healthy male subjects, cimetidine (1,000 mg per day) increased the steady\u2011state AUC of carvedilol by 30% with no change in C max [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Digoxin: Following concomitant administration of carvedilol (25 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 14 days, steady\u2011state AUC and trough concentrations of digoxin were increased by 14% and 16%, respectively, in 12 subjects with hypertension [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Glyburide: In 12 healthy subjects, combined administration of carvedilol (25 mg once daily) and a single dose of glyburide did not result in a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction for either compound. Hydrochlorothiazide: A single oral dose of carvedilol 25 mg did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in 12 subjects with hypertension. Likewise, hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol. Rifampin: In a pharmacokinetic trial conducted in 8 healthy male subjects, rifampin (600 mg daily for 12 days) decreased the AUC and C max of carvedilol by about 70% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Torsemide: In a trial of 12 healthy subjects, combined oral administration of carvedilol 25 mg once daily and torsemide 5 mg once daily for 5 days did not result in any significant differences in their pharmacokinetics compared with administration of the drugs alone. Warfarin: Carvedilol (12.5 mg twice daily) did not have an effect on the steady\u2011state prothrombin time ratios and did not alter the pharmacokinetics of R(+)\u2011 and S(\u2011)\u2011warfarin following concomitant administration with warfarin in 9 healthy volunteers."], "mechanism_of_action": ["12.1 Mechanism of Action Carvedilol is a racemic mixture in which nonselective \u03b2\u2011adrenoreceptor blocking activity is present in the S(-) enantiomer and \u03b1 1 \u2011adrenergic blocking activity is present in both R(+) and S(-) enantiomers at equal potency. Carvedilol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity."], "pharmacodynamics": ["12.2 Pharmacodynamics Heart Failure and Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction The basis for the beneficial effects of carvedilol in patients with heart failure and in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following an acute myocardial infarction is not known. The concentration-response relationship for \u03b2 1 \u2011blockade following administration of COREG CR is equivalent (\u00b120%) to immediate-release carvedilol tablets. Hypertension The mechanism by which \u03b2\u2011blockade produces an antihypertensive effect has not been established. \u03b2\u2011adrenoreceptor blocking activity has been demonstrated in animal and human studies showing that carvedilol (1) reduces cardiac output in normal subjects, (2) reduces exercise- and/or isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (3) reduces reflex orthostatic tachycardia. Significant \u03b2\u2011adrenoreceptor blocking effect is usually seen within 1 hour of drug administration. \u03b1 1 \u2011adrenoreceptor blocking activity has been demonstrated in human and animal studies, showing that carvedilol (1) attenuates the pressor effects of phenylephrine, (2) causes vasodilation, and (3) reduces peripheral vascular resistance. These effects contribute to the reduction of blood pressure and usually are seen within 30 minutes of drug administration. Due to the \u03b1 1 \u2011receptor blocking activity of carvedilol, blood pressure is lowered more in the standing than in the supine position, and symptoms of postural hypotension (1.8%), including rare instances of syncope, can occur. Following oral administration, when postural hypotension has occurred, it has been transient and is uncommon when immediate-release carvedilol is administered with food at the recommended starting dose and titration increments are closely followed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the \u03b2 1 \u2011blocking effect of COREG CR, as measured by heart rate response to submaximal bicycle ergometry, was shown to be equivalent to that observed with immediate-release carvedilol at steady state in adult subjects with essential hypertension. In hypertensive subjects with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of carvedilol decreased renal vascular resistance with no change in glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow. Changes in excretion of sodium, potassium, uric acid, and phosphorus in hypertensive patients with normal renal function were similar after carvedilol and placebo. Carvedilol has little effect on plasma catecholamines, plasma aldosterone, or electrolyte levels, but it does significantly reduce plasma renin activity when given for at least 4 weeks. It also increases levels of atrial natriuretic peptide."], "pharmacokinetics": ["12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Carvedilol is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration of immediate-release carvedilol tablets, with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 25% to 35% due to a significant degree of first-pass metabolism. COREG CR extended-release capsules have approximately 85% of the bioavailability of immediate-release carvedilol tablets. For corresponding dosages [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] , the exposure (AUC, C max , trough concentration) of carvedilol as COREG CR extended-release capsules is equivalent to those of immediate-release carvedilol tablets when both are administered with food. The absorption of carvedilol from COREG CR is slower and more prolonged compared with the immediate-release carvedilol tablet with peak concentrations achieved approximately 5 hours after administration. Plasma concentrations of carvedilol increase in a dose-proportional manner over the dosage range of COREG CR 10 to 80 mg. Within-subject and between-subject variability for AUC and C max is similar for COREG CR and immediate-release carvedilol. Effect of Food: Administration of COREG CR with a high-fat meal resulted in increases (~20%) in AUC and C max compared with COREG CR administered with a standard meal. Decreases in AUC (27%) and C max (43%) were observed when COREG CR was administered in the fasted state compared with administration after a standard meal. COREG CR should be taken with food. In a trial with adult subjects, sprinkling the contents of the COREG CR capsule on applesauce did not appear to have a significant effect on overall exposure (AUC) compared with administration of the intact capsule following a standard meal, but did result in a decrease in C max (18%). Distribution Carvedilol is more than 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily with albumin. The plasma-protein binding is independent of concentration over the therapeutic range. Carvedilol is a basic, lipophilic compound with a steady-state volume of distribution of approximately 115 L, indicating substantial distribution into extravascular tissues. Metabolism and Excretion Carvedilol is extensively metabolized. Following oral administration of radiolabelled carvedilol to healthy volunteers, carvedilol accounted for only about 7% of the total radioactivity in plasma as measured by AUC. Less than 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Carvedilol is metabolized primarily by aromatic ring oxidation and glucuronidation. The oxidative metabolites are further metabolized by conjugation via glucuronidation and sulfation. The metabolites of carvedilol are excreted primarily via the bile into the feces. Demethylation and hydroxylation at the phenol ring produce 3 active metabolites with \u03b2\u2011receptor blocking activity. Based on preclinical studies, the 4'-hydroxyphenyl metabolite is approximately 13 times more potent than carvedilol for \u03b2\u2011blockade. Compared with carvedilol, the 3 active metabolites exhibit weak vasodilating activity. Plasma concentrations of the active metabolites are about one-tenth of those observed for carvedilol and have pharmacokinetics similar to the parent. Carvedilol undergoes stereoselective first-pass metabolism with plasma levels of R(+)-carvedilol approximately 2 to 3 times higher than S(-)-carvedilol following oral administration of COREG CR in healthy subjects. Apparent clearance is 90 L per h and 213 L per h for R(+)- and S(-)-carvedilol, respectively. The primary P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolism of both R(+) and S(-)-carvedilol in human liver microsomes were CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, 2C19, 1A2, and 2E1. CYP2D6 is thought to be the major enzyme in the 4\u2019- and 5\u2019-hydroxylation of carvedilol, with a potential contribution from 3A4. CYP2C9 is thought to be of primary importance in the O-methylation pathway of S(-)-carvedilol. Carvedilol is subject to the effects of genetic polymorphism with poor metabolizers of debrisoquin (a marker for cytochrome P450 2D6) exhibiting 2- to 3-fold higher plasma concentrations of R(+)-carvedilol compared with extensive metabolizers. In contrast, plasma levels of S(-)-carvedilol are increased only about 20% to 25% in poor metabolizers, indicating this enantiomer is metabolized to a lesser extent by cytochrome P450 2D6 than R(+)-carvedilol. The pharmacokinetics of carvedilol do not appear to be different in poor metabolizers of S-mephenytoin (patients deficient in cytochrome P450 2C19). Specific Populations Heart Failure: Following administration of immediate-release carvedilol tablets, steady\u2011state plasma concentrations of carvedilol and its enantiomers increased proportionally over the dose range in subjects with heart failure. Compared with healthy subjects, subjects with heart failure had increased mean AUC and C max values for carvedilol and its enantiomers, with up to 50% to 100% higher values observed in 6 subjects with NYHA class IV heart failure. The mean apparent terminal elimination half\u2011life for carvedilol was similar to that observed in healthy subjects. For corresponding dose levels [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] , the steady-state pharmacokinetics of carvedilol (AUC, C max , trough concentrations) observed after administration of COREG CR to subjects with chronic heart failure (mild, moderate, and severe) were similar to those observed after administration of immediate-release carvedilol tablets. Hypertension: For corresponding dose levels [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] , the pharmacokinetics (AUC, C max , and trough concentrations) observed with administration of COREG CR were equivalent (\u00b120%) to those observed with immediate-release carvedilol tablets following repeat dosing in subjects with essential hypertension. Geriatric: Plasma levels of carvedilol average about 50% higher in the elderly compared with young subjects after administration of immediate-release carvedilol. Hepatic Impairment: No trials have been performed with COREG CR in subjects with hepatic impairment. Compared with healthy subjects, subjects with severe liver impairment (cirrhosis) exhibit a 4\u2011 to 7\u2011fold increase in carvedilol levels. Carvedilol is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment. Renal Impairment: No trials have been performed with COREG CR in subjects with renal impairment. Although carvedilol is metabolized primarily by the liver, plasma concentrations of carvedilol have been reported to be increased in patients with renal impairment after dosing with immediate-release carvedilol. Based on mean AUC data, approximately 40% to 50% higher plasma concentrations of carvedilol were observed in subjects with hypertension and moderate to severe renal impairment compared with a control group of subjects with hypertension and normal renal function. However, the ranges of AUC values were similar for both groups. Changes in mean peak plasma levels were less pronounced, approximately 12% to 26% higher in subjects with impaired renal function. Consistent with its high degree of plasma protein binding, carvedilol does not appear to be cleared significantly by hemodialysis. Drug-Drug Interactions Since carvedilol undergoes substantial oxidative metabolism, the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of carvedilol may be affected by induction or inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes. The following drug interaction trials were performed with immediate-release carvedilol tablets. Amiodarone: In a pharmacokinetic trial conducted in 106 Japanese subjects with heart failure, coadministration of small loading and maintenance doses of amiodarone with carvedilol resulted in at least a 2-fold increase in the steady-state trough concentrations of S(-)-carvedilol [see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )] . Cimetidine: In a pharmacokinetic trial conducted in 10 healthy male subjects, cimetidine (1,000 mg per day) increased the steady\u2011state AUC of carvedilol by 30% with no change in C max [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Digoxin: Following concomitant administration of carvedilol (25 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 14 days, steady\u2011state AUC and trough concentrations of digoxin were increased by 14% and 16%, respectively, in 12 subjects with hypertension [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Glyburide: In 12 healthy subjects, combined administration of carvedilol (25 mg once daily) and a single dose of glyburide did not result in a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction for either compound. Hydrochlorothiazide: A single oral dose of carvedilol 25 mg did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in 12 subjects with hypertension. Likewise, hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol. Rifampin: In a pharmacokinetic trial conducted in 8 healthy male subjects, rifampin (600 mg daily for 12 days) decreased the AUC and C max of carvedilol by about 70% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Torsemide: In a trial of 12 healthy subjects, combined oral administration of carvedilol 25 mg once daily and torsemide 5 mg once daily for 5 days did not result in any significant differences in their pharmacokinetics compared with administration of the drugs alone. Warfarin: Carvedilol (12.5 mg twice daily) did not have an effect on the steady\u2011state prothrombin time ratios and did not alter the pharmacokinetics of R(+)\u2011 and S(\u2011)\u2011warfarin following concomitant administration with warfarin in 9 healthy volunteers."], "nonclinical_toxicology": ["13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In 2\u2011year studies conducted in rats given carvedilol at doses up to 75 mg per kg per day (12 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ) or in mice given up to 200 mg per kg per day (16 times the MRHD as mg per m 2 ), carvedilol had no carcinogenic effect.

The clinical trials performed with immediate-release carvedilol in heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction are presented below. 14.1 Heart Failure A total of 6,975 subjects with mild-to-severe heart failure were evaluated in placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials of immediate-release carvedilol. Mild-to-Moderate Heart Failure Carvedilol was studied in 5 multicenter, placebo\u2011controlled trials, and in 1 active-controlled trial (COMET trial) involving subjects with mild-to-moderate heart failure. Four U.S. multicenter, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled trials enrolled 1,094 subjects (696 randomized to carvedilol) with NYHA class II\u2011III heart failure and ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.35. The vast majority were on digitalis, diuretics, and an ACE inhibitor at trial entry. Subjects were assigned to the trials based upon exercise ability. An Australia\u2011New Zealand double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled trial enrolled 415 subjects (half randomized to immediate\u2011release carvedilol) with less severe heart failure. All protocols excluded subjects expected to undergo cardiac transplantation during the 7.5 to 15 months of double\u2011blind follow\u2011up. All randomized subjects had tolerated a 2\u2011week course on immediate\u2011release carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily. In each trial, there was a primary end point, either progression of heart failure (1 U.S. trial) or exercise tolerance (2 U.S. trials meeting enrollment goals and the Australia\u2011New Zealand trial). There were many secondary end points specified in these trials, including NYHA classification, patient and physician global assessments, and cardiovascular hospitalization. Other analyses not prospectively planned included the sum of deaths and total cardiovascular hospitalizations. In situations where the primary end points of a trial do not show a significant benefit of treatment, assignment of significance values to the other results is complex, and such values need to be interpreted cautiously. The results of the U.S. and Australia\u2011New Zealand trials were as follows: Slowing Progression of Heart Failure: One U.S. multicenter trial (366 subjects) had as its primary end point the sum of cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalization, and sustained increase in heart failure medications. Heart failure progression was reduced, during an average follow\u2011up of 7 months, by 48% ( P = 0.008). In the Australia\u2011New Zealand trial, death and total hospitalizations were reduced by about 25% over 18 to 24 months. In the 3 largest U.S. trials, death and total hospitalizations were reduced by 19%, 39%, and 49%, nominally statistically significant in the last 2 trials. The Australia\u2011New Zealand results were statistically borderline. Functional Measures: None of the multicenter trials had NYHA classification as a primary end point, but all such trials had it as a secondary end point. There was at least a trend toward improvement in NYHA class in all trials. Exercise tolerance was the primary end point in 3 trials; in none was a statistically significant effect found. Subjective Measures: Health-related quality of life, as measured with a standard questionnaire (a primary end point in 1 trial), was unaffected by carvedilol. However, patients\u2019 and investigators\u2019 global assessments showed significant improvement in most trials. Mortality: Death was not a pre-specified end point in any trial but was analyzed in all trials. Overall, in these 4 U.S. trials, mortality was reduced, nominally significantly so in 2 trials. The COMET Trial In this double-blind trial, 3,029 subjects with NYHA class II-IV heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) were randomized to receive either carvedilol (target dose: 25 mg twice daily) or immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose: 50 mg twice daily). The mean age of the subjects was approximately 62 years, 80% were males, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was 26%. Approximately 96% of the subjects had NYHA class II or III heart failure. Concomitant treatment included diuretics (99%), ACE inhibitors (91%), digitalis (59%), aldosterone antagonists (11%), and \u201cstatin\u201d lipid-lowering agents (21%). The mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 years. The mean dose of carvedilol was 42 mg per day. The trial had 2 primary end points: all-cause mortality and the composite of death plus hospitalization for any reason. The results of COMET are presented in Table 5 below. All-cause mortality carried most of the statistical weight and was the primary determinant of the trial size. All-cause mortality was 34% in the subjects treated with carvedilol and was 40% in the immediate-release metoprolol group ( P = 0.0017; hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.93). The effect on mortality was primarily due to a reduction in cardiovascular death. The difference between the 2 groups with respect to the composite end point was not significant ( P = 0.122). The estimated mean survival was 8.0 years with carvedilol and 6.6 years with immediate-release metoprolol. Table 5. Results of COMET End Point Carvedilol n = 1,511 Metoprolol n = 1,518 Hazard Ratio (95% CI) All-cause mortality 34% 40% 0.83 0.74 \u2013 0.93 Mortality + all hospitalization 74% 76% 0.94 0.86 \u2013 1.02 Cardiovascular death 30% 35% 0.80 0.70 \u2013 0.90 Sudden death 14% 17% 0.81 0.68 \u2013 0.97 Death due to circulatory failure 11% 13% 0.83 0.67 \u2013 1.02 Death due to stroke 0.9% 2.5% 0.33 0.18 \u2013 0.62 It is not known whether this formulation of metoprolol at any dose or this low dose of metoprolol in any formulation has any effect on survival or hospitalization in patients with heart failure. Thus, this trial extends the time over which carvedilol manifests benefits on survival in heart failure, but it is not evidence that carvedilol improves outcome over the formulation of metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) with benefits in heart failure. Severe Heart Failure (COPERNICUS) In a double-blind trial, 2,289 subjects with heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25% (mean 20%), despite digitalis (66%), diuretics (99%), and ACE inhibitors (89%), were randomized to placebo or carvedilol. Carvedilol was titrated from a starting dose of 3.125 mg twice daily to the maximum tolerated dose or up to 25 mg twice daily over a minimum of 6 weeks. Most subjects achieved the target dose of 25 mg. The trial was conducted in Eastern and Western Europe, the United States, Israel, and Canada. Similar numbers of subjects per group (about 100) withdrew during the titration period. The primary end point of the trial was all\u2011cause mortality, but cause\u2011specific mortality and the risk of death or hospitalization (total, cardiovascular [CV], or heart failure [HF]) were also examined. The developing trial data were followed by a data monitoring committee, and mortality analyses were adjusted for these multiple looks. The trial was stopped after a median follow\u2011up of 10 months because of an observed 35% reduction in mortality (from 19.7% per patient-year on placebo to 12.8% on carvedilol: hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.81, P = 0.0014, adjusted) (see Figure 1). The results of COPERNICUS are shown in Table 6. Table 6. Results of COPERNICUS Trial in Subjects with Severe Heart Failure Cardiovascular = CV; Heart failure = HF. End Point Placebo (n = 1,133) Carvedilol (n = 1,156) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) % Reduction Nominal P value Mortality 190 130 0.65 (0.52 \u2013 0.81) 35 0.00013 Mortality + all hospitalization 507 425 0.76 (0.67 \u2013 0.87) 24 0.00004 Mortality + CV hospitalization 395 314 0.73 (0.63 \u2013 0.84) 27 0.00002 Mortality + HF hospitalization 357 271 0.69 (0.59 \u2013 0.81) 31 0.000004 Figure 1. Survival Analysis for COPERNICUS (Intent-to-Treat) The effect on mortality was principally the result of a reduction in the rate of sudden death among subjects without worsening heart failure. Patients' global assessments, in which carvedilol\u2011treated subjects were compared with placebo, were based on pre-specified, periodic patient self-assessments regarding whether clinical status post-treatment showed improvement, worsening, or no change compared with baseline. Subjects treated with carvedilol showed significant improvements in global assessments compared with those treated with placebo in COPERNICUS. The protocol also specified that hospitalizations would be assessed. Fewer subjects on immediate\u2011release carvedilol than on placebo were hospitalized for any reason (372 versus 432, P = 0.0029), for cardiovascular reasons (246 versus 314, P = 0.0003), or for worsening heart failure (198 versus 268, P = 0.0001). Immediate\u2011release carvedilol had a consistent and beneficial effect on all\u2011cause mortality as well as the combined end points of all\u2011cause mortality plus hospitalization (total, CV, or for heart failure) in the overall trial population and in all subgroups examined, including men and women, elderly and non\u2011elderly, blacks and non\u2011blacks, and diabetics and non-diabetics (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Effects on Mortality for Subgroups in COPERNICUS Although the clinical trials used twice-daily dosing, clinical pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic data provide a reasonable basis for concluding that once-daily dosing with COREG CR should be adequate in the treatment of heart failure. Figure 1. Survival Analysis for COPERNICUS (intent-to-treat) Figure 2. Effects on Mortality for Subgroups in COPERNICUS 14.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction CAPRICORN was a double\u2011blind trial comparing carvedilol and placebo in 1,959 subjects with a recent myocardial infarction (within 21 days) and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40%, with (47%) or without symptoms of heart failure. Subjects given carvedilol received 6.25 mg twice daily, titrated as tolerated to 25 mg twice daily. Subjects had to have a systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, a sitting heart rate greater than 60 beats per minute, and no contraindication to \u03b2\u2011blocker use. Treatment of the index infarction included aspirin (85%), IV or oral \u03b2\u2011blockers (37%), nitrates (73%), heparin (64%), thrombolytics (40%), and acute angioplasty (12%). Background treatment included ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (97%), anticoagulants (20%), lipid\u2011lowering agents (23%), and diuretics (34%). Baseline population characteristics included an average age of 63 years, 74% male, 95% Caucasian, mean blood pressure 121/74 mm Hg, 22% with diabetes, and 54% with a history of hypertension. Mean dosage achieved of carvedilol was 20 mg twice daily; mean duration of follow\u2011up was 15 months. All\u2011cause mortality was 15% in the placebo group and 12% in the carvedilol group, indicating a 23% risk reduction in subjects treated with carvedilol (95% CI: 2% to 40%, P = 0.03), as shown in Figure 3. The effects on mortality in various subgroups are shown in Figure 4. Nearly all deaths were cardiovascular (which were reduced by 25% by carvedilol), and most of these deaths were sudden or related to pump failure (both types of death were reduced by carvedilol). Another trial end point, total mortality and all-cause hospitalization, did not show a significant improvement. There was also a significant 40% reduction in fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction observed in the group treated with carvedilol (95% CI: 11% to 60%, P = 0.01). A similar reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction was also observed in a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials of carvedilol in heart failure. Figure 3. Survival Analysis for CAPRICORN (Intent-to-Treat) Figure 4. Effects on Mortality for Subgroups in CAPRICORN Although the clinical trials used twice-daily dosing, clinical pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic data provide a reasonable basis for concluding that once-daily dosing with COREG CR should be adequate in the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. Figure 3. Survival Analysis for CAPRICORN (intent-to-treat) Figure 4. Effects on Mortality for Subgroups in CAPRICORN 14.3 Hypertension A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 8-week trial evaluated the blood pressure-lowering effects of COREG CR 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg once daily in 338 subjects with essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] greater than or equal to 90 and less than or equal to 109 mm Hg). Of 337 evaluable subjects, a total of 273 subjects (81%) completed the trial. Of the 64 (19%) subjects withdrawn from the trial, 10 (3%) were due to adverse events, 10 (3%) were due to lack of efficacy; the remaining 44 (13%) withdrew for other reasons. The mean age of the subjects was approximately 53 years, 66% were male, and the mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP at baseline were 150 mm Hg and 99 mm Hg, respectively. Dose titration occurred at 2\u2011week intervals. Statistically significant reductions in blood pressure as measured by 24\u2011hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were observed with each dose of COREG CR compared with placebo. Placebo-subtracted mean changes from baseline in mean SBP/DBP were \u20116.1/\u20114.0 mm Hg, \u20119.4/\u20117.6 mm Hg, and \u201111.8/\u20119.2 mm Hg for COREG CR 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg, respectively. Placebo-subtracted mean changes from baseline in mean trough (average of hours 20 to 24) SBP/DBP were \u20113.3/\u20112.8 mm Hg, \u20114.9/\u20115.2 mm Hg, and \u20118.4/\u20117.4 mm Hg for COREG CR 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg, respectively. The placebo-corrected trough-to-peak (3 to 7 h) ratio was approximately 0.6 for COREG CR 80 mg. In this trial, assessments of 24\u2011hour ABPM monitoring demonstrated statistically significant blood pressure reductions with COREG CR throughout the dosing period (Figure 5). Figure 5. Changes from Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure and Diastolic Blood Pressure Measured by 24-Hour ABPM Immediate\u2011release carvedilol was studied in 2 placebo\u2011controlled trials that utilized twice\u2011daily dosing at total daily doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In these and other trials, the starting dose did not exceed 12.5 mg. At 50 mg per day, COREG reduced sitting trough (12\u2011hour) blood pressure by about 9/5.5 mm Hg; at 25 mg per day the effect was about 7.5/3.5 mm Hg. Comparisons of trough\u2011to\u2011peak blood pressure showed a trough\u2011to\u2011peak ratio for blood pressure response of about 65%. Heart rate fell by about 7.5 beats per minute at 50 mg per day. In general, as is true for other \u03b2\u2011blockers, responses were smaller in black than non\u2011black subjects. There were no age\u2011 or gender\u2011related differences in response. The dose\u2011related blood pressure response was accompanied by a dose\u2011related increase in adverse effects [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Figure 5. Changes from Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure and Diastolic Blood Pressure Measured by 24-Hour ABPM 14.4 Hypertension with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In a double-blind trial (GEMINI), carvedilol, added to an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, was evaluated in a population with mild\u2011to\u2011moderate hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.2%. COREG was titrated to a mean dose of 17.5 mg twice daily and maintained for 5 months. COREG had no adverse effect on glycemic control, based on HbA1c measurements (mean change from baseline of 0.02%, 95% CI: \u20110.06 to 0.10, P = NS) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] ."], "clinical_studies_table": ["<table ID=\"_Ref54776591\" width=\"100%\"><caption>Table 5.

Active ingredient: carvedilol phosphate Inactive ingredients: crospovidone, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymers, microcrystalline cellulose, and povidone. COREG CR capsules come in the following strengths: 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg. What is high blood pressure (hypertension)? Blood pressure is the force of blood in your blood vessels when your heart beats and when your heart rests. You have high blood pressure when the force is too much. High blood pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood through the body and causes damage to blood vessels. COREG CR can help your blood vessels relax so your blood pressure is lower. Medicines that lower blood pressure may lower your chance of having a stroke or heart attack. COREG CR and COREG are trademarks owned by or licensed to the GSK group of companies.

( 1 , 5.1 , 8.4 )"], "dosage_and_administration": ["2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous infusion only into a central vein. ( 2.1 , 5.10 ) See full prescribing information regarding preparation, administration, instructions for use, the recommended dosage in adults, and dosage modifications for patients with renal impairment. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ) 2.1 Administration KABIVEN is for intravenous infusion only into a central vein [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. Use a 1.2 micron in-line filter. Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism. Use a dedicated line without any connections. Multiple connections could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed. Do not exceed the recommended maximum infusion rate of 2.6 mL/kg/hour [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing intravenous solutions such as KABIVEN via a Y-site due to precipitation. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and KABIVEN may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Do not use administration sets and lines that contain di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Administration sets that contain polyvinyl chloride (PVC) components have DEHP as a plasticizer. 2.2 Important Preparation Instructions Inspect the bag prior to activation. Discard the bag in the following situations: Evidence of damage to the bag More than one chamber is white Solution is yellow Any seal is already broken Activate the bag [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Once the bag is activated, ensure the vertical seals between chambers are broken at least from the bend in the seals and down to the ports. The upper sections of the vertical seals above the bend and the horizontal seal may remain closed. It is recommended to mix the contents thoroughly by inverting the bag upside down to ensure a homogenous admixture. Ensure the vertical seals between chambers are broken and the contents of all three chambers are mixed together prior to infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Use KABIVEN immediately after the introduction of additives. If not used immediately, the storage time and conditions prior to use should not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). After removal from storage at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F), the admixture should be infused within 24 hours. Any mixture remaining must be discarded. In the absence of additives, once activated, KABIVEN remains stable for 48 hours at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). If not used immediately, the activated bag can be stored for up to 7 days under refrigeration [2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00ba to 46\u00b0F)]. After removal from refrigeration, the activated bag should be used within 48 hours. For total parenteral nutrition add multivitamins and trace elements via the additive port. Any other additions to the bag should be evaluated by a pharmacist for compatibility. Questions about compatibility may be directed to Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC. When introducing additives, it is recommended to use 18 to 23 gauge needles with a maximum length of 1.5 inches (40 mm) and to mix thoroughly after each addition, use aseptic technique and add after the vertical seals have been broken (i.e. bag has been activated) and the three components are mixed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect KABIVEN to ensure: Precipitates have not formed during the mixing or addition of additives. The emulsion has not separated. Separation of the emulsion can be visibly identified by a yellowish streaking or the accumulation of yellowish droplets in the mixed emulsion. Discard the admixture if any of the above are observed. 2.3 Instructions for Use Overpouch Notch Handle Hole (For hanging the bag) Vertical Seals (Must break to activate) Bends in Vertical Seals Horizontal Seal (May remain unopened) Blind Port (NEVER use this port) WHITE Additive Port BLUE Infusion Port Oxygen Absorber (Present between bag and inside overpouch-position may vary) An instructional video is available at www.freseniuskabinutrition.com/products/kabiv en-perikabiven/. 1.

Discard unused portion. Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure 2.4 Dosing Considerations The dosage of KABIVEN should be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition (ability to adequately metabolize amino acids, dextrose and lipids), body weight and nutritional/fluid requirements, as well as additional energy given orally/enterally to the patient. KABIVEN is a combination of amino acids, electrolytes, dextrose, and lipids in a fixed volume and concentration. The dosage selection is based upon fluid requirements which can be used in conjunction with the nutritional requirements to determine final dosage [see Table 1 ]. KABIVEN meets the total nutritional requirements for protein, dextrose and lipids in stable patients, and can be individualized to meet specific needs with the addition of nutrients. The maximum infusion rate is based upon the dextrose component. Prior to administration of KABIVEN, correct severe fluid, electrolyte and acid-base disorders. Before starting the infusion, obtain serum triglyceride levels to establish the baseline value. Recommended Adult Dosage The recommended dosage of KABIVEN in adults is 19 to 38 mL/kg/day. The amount of macronutrients provided by KABIVEN are shown in Table 1 . The maximum daily dosage of KABIVEN in adults should not exceed 40 mL/kg/day. In patients with serum triglyceride concentrations above 400 mg/dL, stop the KABIVEN infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels. Once the triglycerides are <400 mg/dL, restart KABIVEN at a lower infusion rate and advance rate in smaller increments towards target dosage, checking the triglyceride levels prior to each adjustment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] . Table 1: Macronutrient Content of KABIVEN Based on Recommended Dosage * Protein is provided as amino acids. When infused intravenously amino acids are metabolized and utilized as the building blocks of protein. ** As Dextrose monohydrate Nutrition Provided by KABIVEN recommended dosage Fluid mL/kg/day 19 to 38 Protein* g/kg/day Nitrogen g/kg/day 0.6 to 1.3 0.1 to 0.2 Dextrose** g/kg/day 2.1 to 4.1 Lipids g/kg/day 0.7 to 1.5 Total Energy Requirement kcal/kg/day 16 to 32 Treatment with KABIVEN may be continued for as long as is required by the patient's condition. Dosing in Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, the dosage of KABIVEN should be the recommended adult dosage (see above). Prior to administration, correct severe fluid or electrolyte imbalances. Closely monitor serum electrolyte levels and adjust the volume of KABIVEN administered as required [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . Renal patients not needing dialysis require 0.6 to 0.8 g of protein/kg/day. Patients on dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy should receive 1.2 to 1.8 g of protein/kg/day up to a maximum of 2.5 g of protein/kg/day based on nutritional status and estimated protein losses. The KABIVEN dosage can be adjusted based on the treatment for the renal impairment, supplementing protein as indicated. If required, additional amino acids may be added to the KABIVEN bag or infused separately. Infusion Duration and Rate The recommended duration of infusion for KABIVEN is between 12 and 24 hours, depending on the clinical situation. The maximum infusion rate of KABIVEN is 2.6 mL/kg/hour. This corresponds to 0.09 g/kg/hour of amino acids, 0.28 g/kg/hour of dextrose (the rate limiting factor) and 0.1 g/kg/hour of lipids. Dosing Instructions Determine the fluid requirements (19 to 38 mL/kg/day) and the patient's nutritional requirements to be delivered, and then select the corresponding KABIVEN bag. Determine the preferred duration of infusion (12 to 24 hours). Ensure that the rate of infusion (KABIVEN dosage in mL/kg/day divided by the preferred duration of infusion (hours)) does not exceed the maximum infusion rate for the patient (i.e., 2.6 mL/kg/hour). The infusion rate may need to be reduced and duration of infusion increased in order not to exceed the maximum infusion rate. Once the infusion rate in mL/kg/hour has been selected, calculate the infusion rate (mL/hour) using the patient's weight. Compare the patient's nutrient requirements with the amount supplied by KABIVEN.

( 5.1 ) Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease : Increased risk in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for greater than 2 weeks. Monitor liver tests; if abnormalities occur, consider discontinuation or dosage reduction. ( 5.2 ) Pulmonary Embolism and Respiratory Distress due to Pulmonary Vascular Precipitates: If signs of pulmonary distress occur, stop the infusion and initiate a medical evaluation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Monitor for signs or symptoms and discontinue infusion if reactions occur. ( 5.4 ) Precipitation with Ceftriaxone: Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with KABIVEN via a Y-site. ( 4 , 5.5 , 8.4 ) Infection, fat overload, hyperglycemia and refeeding complications : Monitor for signs and symptoms; monitor laboratory parameters. ( 5.6 , 5.7 , 5.8 , 5.9 , 5.14 ) 5.1 Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants In the postmarketing setting, serious adverse reactions including acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death have been reported in neonates and infants after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions. Hypertriglyceridemia was commonly reported. Preterm and small for gestational age infants have poor clearance of intravenous lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion. 5.2 Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease and Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Risk of Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD), also referred to as intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD), can present as cholestasis or hepatic steatosis, and may progress to steatohepatitis with fibrosis and cirrhosis (possibly leading to chronic hepatic failure). The etiology of PNALD is multifactorial; however, intravenously administered phytosterols (plant sterols) contained in plant-derived lipid emulsions, such as Intralipid (included in KABIVEN), have been associated with development of PNALD. In a randomized study of neonates and infants expected to be treated with PN for at least 28 days, parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC), a precursor to PNALD, developed more frequently in Intralipid-treated patients than in patients treated with a 4-oil mixed lipid emulsion [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Monitor liver tests in patients treated with KABIVEN and consider discontinuation or dosage reduction if abnormalities occur. Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatobiliary disorders including cholecystitis and cholelithiasis have developed in some PN-treated patients without preexisting liver disease. Monitor liver tests when administering KABIVEN. Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early to determine whether these conditions are related to KABIVEN use. 5.3 Pulmonary Embolism and Respiratory Distress due to Pulmonary Vascular Precipitates Pulmonary vascular precipitates causing pulmonary emboli (including some fatalities) and respiratory distress have been reported in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Excessive addition of calcium and phosphate increases the risk of the formation of calcium phosphate precipitates; however, precipitates have been reported even in the absence of phosphate salt in the solution. Precipitation following passage through an in-line filter and suspected in vivo precipitate formation has also been reported. Visually inspect the prepared solution, the infusion set, and catheter for precipitates, prior to administration as well as periodically during the administration. If signs of respiratory distress or pulmonary embolism occur, stop the KABIVEN infusion and initiate a medical evaluation. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions KABIVEN contains soybean oil, which may cause hypersensitivity reactions. Cross reactions have been observed between soybean and peanut. KABIVEN is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to egg, soybean, peanut or any of the active or inactive ingredients in KABIVEN. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop infusion of KABIVEN immediately and initiate appropriate treatment and supportive measures. 5.5 Precipitation with Ceftriaxone Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing parenteral nutrition solutions, such as KABIVEN in the same intravenous administration line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with KABIVEN via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and KABIVEN may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Pediatric Use ( 8.4 )]. 5.6 Infections Parenteral nutrition, such as KABIVEN, can support microbial growth and is an independent risk factor for the development of catheter-related bloodstream infections. To decrease the risk of infectious complications, ensure aseptic techniques are used for catheter placement, catheter maintenance, and preparation and administration of KABIVEN. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection including fever and chills, as well as laboratory test results that might indicate infection (including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia). Perform frequent checks of the intravenous catheter insertion site for edema, redness, and discharge. 5.7 Fat Overload Syndrome Fat overload syndrome is a rare condition that has been reported with intravenous lipid formulations and is characterized by a sudden deterioration in the patient's condition (e.g., fever, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders, hyperlipidemia, hepatomegaly, deteriorating liver function, and central nervous system manifestations such as coma). A reduced or limited ability to metabolize lipids, accompanied by prolonged plasma clearance (resulting in higher lipid levels), may result in this syndrome. Although fat overload syndrome has been most frequently observed when the recommended lipid dose or infusion rate was exceeded, cases have also been described when the lipid formulation was administered according to instructions. If signs or symptoms of fat overload syndrome occur, stop KABIVEN. The syndrome is usually reversible when the infusion including the lipid emulsion is stopped. 5.8 Refeeding Syndrome Administering PN to severely malnourished patients may result in refeeding syndrome, characterized by the intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as patients become anabolic. Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. To prevent these complications, closely monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase their nutrient intake. 5.9 Diabetes and Hyperglycemia Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, hyperosmolar coma, and death. Monitor blood glucose levels and treat hyperglycemia to maintain optimal glucose levels while infusing KABIVEN. Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose levels during KABIVEN administration. 5.10 Hypertriglyceridemia The use of KABIVEN is contraindicated in patients with hypertriglyceridemia with serum triglyceride concentrations >1,000 mg/dL. Patients with conditions such as inherited lipid disorders, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndromes have a higher risk of developing hypertriglyceridemia with the use of KABIVEN. In addition, patients with hypertriglyceridemia may have worsening of their hypertriglyceridemia with administration of KABIVEN. Excessive dextrose administration may further increase such risk. Evaluate patients' capacity to eliminate and metabolize the infused lipid emulsion by measuring serum triglycerides before the start of infusion (baseline value), with each increase in dosage, and regularly throughout treatment. If triglyceride levels are above 400 mg/dL in adults, stop the KABIVEN infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels to avoid clinical consequences of hypertriglyceridemia such as pancreatitis. To minimize the risk of new or worsening of hypertriglyceridemia, assess high-risk patients for their overall energy intake including other sources of lipid and dextrose, as well as concomitant drugs that may affect lipid and dextrose metabolism. 5.11 Vein Damage and Thrombosis The infusion of hypertonic nutrient injections into a peripheral vein may result in vein irritation, vein damage, and/or thrombosis. KABIVEN is only approved for administration into a central vein, such as the superior vena cava [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Remove the catheter as soon as possible if thrombophlebitis develops. 5.12 Electrolyte Imbalance and Fluid Overload in Patients with Decreased Renal Function Patients with decreased renal function, including those with pre-renal azotemia, renal obstruction, or intrinsic renal disease, may be at increased risk of electrolyte and fluid volume imbalance when receiving PN, including KABIVEN. In patients with decreased renal function with electrolyte imbalance or fluid overload, the KABIVEN dosage (e.g., fluid, protein, and electrolyte content) may require adjustment. Monitor renal function parameters. Patients developing signs of decreased renal function should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in renal disease in order to determine the appropriate KABIVEN dosage. 5.13 Aluminum Toxicity KABIVEN contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. The aluminum contained in KABIVEN may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with impaired kidney function. Preterm infants are at greater risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions that contain aluminum. Patients with impaired kidney function, including preterm infants, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration of total parenteral nutrition products. 5.14 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests Monitor fluid status closely in patients with pulmonary edema or heart failure. Throughout treatment, monitor serum triglycerides [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] , fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count (including platelets), and coagulation parameters. KABIVEN contains Vitamin K that may counteract anticoagulant activity [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . The lipids contained in KABIVEN may interfere with some laboratory tests (e.g., hemoglobin, triglycerides, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin and oxygen saturation) if blood is sampled before the lipids have cleared from the bloodstream. Conduct these tests at least 6 hours after stopping the infusion."], "adverse_reactions": ["6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information.

The clinical data described for KABIVEN reflects exposure in 145 patients exposed for 7 days to 4 weeks in 7 active-controlled trials. The pooled population exposed to KABIVEN was 25 to 87 years old, 35% female, 99% Caucasian. The enrolled patients had varied underlying conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders (41%) neoplasms (48%), vascular disorders (35%) and other surgical procedures (21%). Most patients received central intravenous infusion doses of \u226580% of their target mean daily exposure. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of patients who received KABIVEN are shown in Table 3 .

In a randomized active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-center study that included 152 neonates and 9 patients ranging in age from 29 to 153 days who were expected to require PN for at least 28 days, parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC), a precursor to PNALD, developed more frequently in Intralipid-treated patients than in patients treated with a 4-oil mixed lipid emulsion. Intralipid is the lipid emulsion component of KABIVEN. PNAC (defined as direct bilirubin >2mg/dl with a second confirmed elevation >2mg/dl at least 7 days later) occurred in 11.5% (9/78) of Intralipid-treated patients and 2.4% (2/83) of patients treated with a 4-oil mixed lipid emulsion. Most PNAC events occurred in patients who were treated for longer than 28 days. The estimated cumulative incidence of PNAC is shown in the Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curve in Figure 1 . Figure 1: Cumulative Incidence Curve of Time to Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Cholestasis (PNAC) with Standard Error Bars Monitor liver tests in patients treated with KABIVEN and consider discontinuation or dosage reduction if abnormalities occur. Figure 1 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of KABIVEN in countries where it is registered. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure.

However, there are clinical considerations if KABIVEN is used in pregnant women [see Clinical Considerations ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KABIVEN. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk Severe malnutrition in a pregnant woman is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, congenital malformations and perinatal mortality. Parenteral nutrition should be considered if a pregnant woman's nutritional requirements cannot be fulfilled by oral or enteral intake. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to assess the presence of KABIVEN and/or its active metabolite(s) in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for KABIVEN, and any potential adverse effects of KABIVEN on the breastfed child or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of KABIVEN has not been established in pediatric patients of any age.

"clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action KABIVEN is used as a supplement or as the sole source of nutrition in patients, providing macronutrients (amino acids, dextrose and lipids) and micronutrients (electrolytes) parenterally. The amino acids provide the structural units that make up proteins and are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy. The administered dextrose is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, yielding energy. Intravenously administered lipids provide a biologically utilizable source of calories and essential fatty acids. Fatty acids serve as an important substrate for energy production. The most common mechanism of action for energy derived from fatty acid metabolism is beta- oxidation. Fatty acids are important for membrane structure and function, precursors for bioactive molecules (such as prostaglandins), and as regulators of gene expression. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The infused lipid particles provided by KABIVEN are expected to be cleared from the blood stream in a manner thought to be comparable to the clearing of chylomicrons. In healthy volunteers, the maximum clearance rate of the triglycerides after fasting overnight has been found to be 3.8 \u00b1 1.5 g/kg per 24 hours. Both elimination and oxidation rates are dependent on the patient's clinical condition; elimination is faster and utilization is increased in postoperative patients, in sepsis, burns and trauma, while patients with renal impairment and hypertriglyceridemia may show lower utilization of exogenous lipid emulsions. Due to differences in elimination, patients with these conditions should be closely monitored during KABIVEN administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 , 5.13 )] . The disposition of infused amino acids, dextrose and electrolytes are essentially the same as those supplied by ordinary food. A clinical study in healthy volunteers employing high intravenous doses (80 mmol) of either sodium glycerophosphate used in KABIVEN or reference, inorganic sodium phosphate demonstrated that both compounds resulted in comparable serum inorganic phosphate concentrations after a single intravenous dose. Changes from baseline in the serum levels of sodium, potassium and total calcium were comparable across the two phosphate sources in this study."], "mechanism_of_action": ["12.1 Mechanism of Action KABIVEN is used as a supplement or as the sole source of nutrition in patients, providing macronutrients (amino acids, dextrose and lipids) and micronutrients (electrolytes) parenterally. The amino acids provide the structural units that make up proteins and are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy. The administered dextrose is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, yielding energy. Intravenously administered lipids provide a biologically utilizable source of calories and essential fatty acids.
